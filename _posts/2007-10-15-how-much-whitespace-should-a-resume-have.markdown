I have to update my resume, so I was thinking about snazzing it up. Im really not sure about these resume templates. They all look great, but isn't a resume primarily about a font large enough to read, and getting your message across?<!--more-->

Should I cut out content from my current resume to fit in this format?
Or should I use my current format and say "Forget you apple"?

Here's my current format:
