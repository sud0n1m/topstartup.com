I hope so! Since I moved to Houston, I've been using Continental Airlines primarily. As a carrier they service a lot of cities, offer competetive fares, have good customer service and don't do a lot of the crap other airlines do. Now Virgin America has approval to launch and will be flying San Fran to New York first. Boston is a city they are considering too. Please pick us!

Back in January, I heard about <a href="http://virginamerica.com">Virgin America</a> through an article on the <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2007/01/17/virgin-cant-get-off-the-ground/">Freakonomics blog</a>. In a nutshell, what's exciting to me about Virgin America is - ethernet at every seat, power at every seat, entertainment platform built on linux.

My girlfriend always makes fun of me for being a geek, but what can I say, IM A GEEK!

Check out the videos of what they're doing differently at virgin america:

What will be interesting is how much debauchery gets organized using the seat to seat chat system. Or maybe that is just a geek fantasy!
