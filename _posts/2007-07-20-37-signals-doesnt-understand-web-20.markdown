I was reading a review by <a href="http://www.robbyonrails.com/articles/2007/03/20/review-highrise-part-2">Robby on Rails about Highrise</a>. One of the responders, <a href="http://livinginsmallsizes.com/">Will</a> had this to say about 37 Signals:
<blockquote>It doesnâ€™t make sense to me. On the web (2.0) the mantra is integration, and yet here we have a single company releases compartmentalized applications that are an ideal extension of one another.</blockquote>
<!--more-->
Will hit the nail on the head. I couldn't have said it better.

I want to use Highrise as the contact manager for Basecamp. Why have contacts in Highrise and Basecamp? Why have Highrise tasks <em>and </em>Basecamp to-dos? What is the real difference between a "case" and a "milestone" or "project". The lack of integration between the 37 Signals apps is shameful. Its as if they were all developed by separate companies! What is the benefit to me to use Basecamp and Highrise? I might as well be using Basecamp and Plaxo or Project (yuck!) and Outlook.

Don't even get me started on what a pain it is that I can't sync my contacts to my Mac address book (open APIs dont create applications, people do). 37 Signals should fix this stuff before I stop shooting my mouth off and start building a team to do it right! Anyone with me?
