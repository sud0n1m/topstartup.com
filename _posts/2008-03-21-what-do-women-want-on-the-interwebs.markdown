I attended a talk at Harvard tonight by Lisa Stone of <a href="http://www.blogher.com/">BlogHer</a> entitiled "What Women Want". Much of the time was focused on what women don't want. This made her seem angry. Angry at the world for marginalizing women on the internet. Angry at Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama for not doing an interview on camera with BlogHer (a lot of time was focused here). Im not sure what made her so angry, but it was a little offputting. She did throw in some great stats about how women are using the net.

Steve Garfield captured the event, so check out his 20 minute video if you're curious.
