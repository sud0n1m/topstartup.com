<a href="http://www.vamoosebus.com/"><img src="http://img223.imageshack.us/img223/13/vamoosebusof4.png" alt="Vamoose Bus" align="left"/></a>I recently wrote about <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/10/25/greyhound-matches-fung-wah-for-cheap-fares-to-new-york/">taking Greyhound rather than the Fung Wah to New York</a>. Believe it or not, there is an even <strong>better</strong> option.<!--more--> <a href="http://www.vamoosebus.com/">Vamoose will get you from boston to New York with free Wifi for $20 each way</a>. The fine print requires you to buy a round trip, and Wifi is not available on all buses. The cool thing is, you can catch the bus close to Harvard Station or the Prudential Center. Next time I'm in NY, it will be on a Vamoose bus.
