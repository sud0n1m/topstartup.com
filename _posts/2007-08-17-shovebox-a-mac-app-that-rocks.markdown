The criteria for shameless promotion is high. It's about as high as the criteria for me calling you one of my friends. My friend Dan Grover at Wonderwarp Software just released version 1.0 of his new app <a href="http://www.wonderwarp.com/shovebox/">Shovebox</a>

<a href="http://www.wonderwarp.com/shovebox/">Shovebox</a> is great name, because that's what the app is. It's a box that you <em>shove </em>stuff in to. It competes in the same class of apps as Yojimbo and Eagle Filer. The <a href="http://www.wonderwarp.com/shovebox/">Shovebox</a> approach is to have a little box in the menu bar like you see below:

When you want to add something, drag and drop it to the box. Organize your notes and clippings later. <a href="http://www.wonderwarp.com/shovebox/">Shovebox</a> allows you to dump your brain when you get a thought or see something interesting. This allows you to focus on the activity at hand.

Basically, I use shovebox to store "stuff" and Actiontastic to store "things I need to do". Shovebox is a great addition to my arsenal. I had been toying with Yojimbo, but couldn't find a reason to justify the $40. $25 for Shovebox is easier to swallow.

<strong> Things I'd love to be able to store in Shovebox
</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Passwords (integration with keychain)</li>
	<li>Serial Numbers</li>
	<li>Web archive from firefox  (only works w/ Safari now)</li>
</ul>
