I couldn't resist. Found this gem in a <a href="http://ask.slashdot.org/askslashdot/07/07/15/1853241.shtml">Slashdot thread on BeOS</a>.

<a href="http://slashdot.org/~iluvcapra">Iluvcapra</a> said:

<p id="comment_body_19870849">This is good, I like this political stuff:

MS-DOS 1.0 was <strong>Herbert Hoover</strong>, aloof to the problems of the common man but friend of the engineer in all of us.  Also discovered Transformers.

Mac OS 7-8-9, all <strong>Franklin Roosevelt</strong>, very competent, lead us through difficult times, but left a legacy of programs which have become quite a mixed bag.<!--more-->

Windows 3.1, <strong>Dwight Eisenhower</strong>, amiable enough, competent, but leaving historians (and many contemporaries) very wanting.

Windows 95 thru ME, <strong>Lyndon Johnson</strong>, one of the boys, very able at getting things done, but in the end a disaster, rightfully ceding his throne.

Windows NT, <strong>Richard Nixon</strong>, the archetypal back-room politician, ruthless, and ultimately brought down by little faults, but many believe he was a great president and did much to modernize the Republican Party.

Windows XP, <strong>Ronald Reagan</strong>, everybody who hates him never met him, he could charm anyone, the Great Communicator. Bought Iranian weapons for contras with drug money.

Mac OS X, <strong>Bill Clinton</strong>, cheerful and smart, if not the most productive.  Known for his speeches.</blockquote>
Then <a href="http://slashdot.org/~nomadic">nomadic</a> finished it with:
<blockquote>Vista, <strong>George W. Bush</strong>, elected because of his name, even though the prior iteration wasn't especially respected or well-liked. Introduced instability and performance issues, all in the name of "security". Many of the corporate interests who promoted him early on are having second thoughts.</blockquote>
I have a geek trapped inside that's laughing hysterically at these.
