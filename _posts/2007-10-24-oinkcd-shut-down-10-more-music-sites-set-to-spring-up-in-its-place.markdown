Of course this will be hailed as a win for the recording industry, but what will the outcome be?<!--more-->

My prediction is that 10 more music sites will fill in the void that Oink.cd leaves. The pirates will learn a lesson or two and get smarter. The cops will pat themselves on the back and eat some donuts.

Like the war on drugs, the war on piracy is a lost cause. The demand for pirated goods is driven by consumers. As long as the duplication cost is perceived to be unfairly lower than the retail price, consumers will have a strong motivation to pirate.
