T-mobile has an under publicized plan called "T-mobile total internet add-on". For $19.99 a month extra (you need a voice plan first), you get unlimited data on your iPhone in addition to included hotspot access at Starbucks. 

T-mobile also sells hotspot access for $19.99 a month, but you'd have to be stupid to pay for that. I switched from my blackberry data plan (also $19.99) to t-mobile Total internet with no hassles, and no problems. When you call up, t-mobile can tell you're using an iPhone and generally the staff there is pretty interested in helping you get the most out of your iPhone on t-mobile.
