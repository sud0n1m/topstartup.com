<a href="http://www.justthrive.com"><img align="left" title="thrive" src="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/thrive-1.png" alt="Thrive - Watch your money grow" width="173" height="111" /></a>Amidst the financial crisis and impending fire and brimstone of the economic apocalypse (isn't the media great), I've started a new chapter in my journey towards a Top Startup. <a href="http://justthrive.com">Thrive</a>.

Avi Karnani, our tenacious CEO convinced me to forgo dreams of the west coast and join the team in New York. I started in the beginning of September as the Product Manager.
<h3>What are we doing?</h3>
<blockquote>...we're building the first on-line, 24/7 financial advisory for young adults. We help people in their twenties and thirties gain control over their financial lives by helping them figure out what to do with their money-aside from spending it!</blockquote>

The Loudwater Labs team had been hard at work with Thrive before I joined, and I'm honored to be working with such a talented group of people. The website is ready for you to use it, so <a href="https://www.justthrive.com/index.seam">try it for free</a> and tell me what you think in the comments below. 

p.s. We're also looking for <a href="https://www.justthrive.com/footerpages/jobs.seam">talented software engineers</a> to join the team.
