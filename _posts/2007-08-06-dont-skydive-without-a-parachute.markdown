I've been reading The Monk and the Riddle. It's a wonderful book about entrepreneurship from Web 1.0 days with many great lessons. As valuable as these are, I have one thought aptly described by a quote from the movie "Good Will Hunting".<!--more-->
<blockquote>If I ask you about women. You would probably give me a syllabus of your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times. But you can't tell me what it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. You're a tough kid. If I was to ask you about war you'd probably throw Shakespeare at me, right? Once more into the breech dear friends. But you've never been near one. You've never held your best friend's head in your lap, and watch him gasp his last breath looking to you for help.</blockquote>
<strong>Nothing beats experience.</strong>

As much as we can learn from books, they <em>cant</em> replace experience. Im an impatient person. I left my job and thought "Im going to go and become a successful tech entrepreneur". Ambition is great, but I've learned something since leaving. Unless you have $500,000 to burn on making mistakes, work for someone else to learn the ropes. It is faster.

Starting a business is like skydiving. However, instead of a parachute, you jump out of the plane with fabric, a needle and thread. Learn to sew first. Otherwise, good luck!
