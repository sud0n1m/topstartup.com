Well, they're underway! They're on their fifth day of about 40. Definitely check out the <a href="http://biketripblog.com">elifelist bike trip blog</a> and show Lee and Brent your support.

They're trying to raise money for the Lance Armstrong foundation. They need your moral and <a href="http://www.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?ievent=158934&amp;supid=176966794">fiscal</a> support! (You could also <a href="http://digg.com/other_sports/eLIFELIST_com_s_Bicycle_Trip_Across_the_US_raising_funds_for_Livestrong">digg their site</a> to get them publicity!)
