I can't find a single property in the Back Bay, Beacon Hill or South End where the rental income covers the costs. Im looking at multiple unit buildings (4 - 6 units) with a cap at around $2 million.<!--more-->

Im assuming:
<ul>
	<li> 20% down</li>
	<li>30 yr mortgage</li>
	<li>6.0% interest</li>
	<li>tax at 2.69%</li>
	<li>insurance at 0.6%</li>
	<li>repairs at 0.5%</li>
	<li>vacancy at 8.33%</li>
</ul>
In my analysis, many properties' income covers around 50 - 70%. The best I have seen covers 92% (603 Mass Ave). The building requires serious repairs and is in a sketchy area.

What am I missing here? Does the Boston property market suck? Does someone give you $20,000 a year just for being a property owner that Im not aware of?
