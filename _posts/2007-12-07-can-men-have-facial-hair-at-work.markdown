This includes weird t-shirts, casual (slovenly?) appearance and ... facial hair! I got back from Argentina with over a week worth of hair on my face. I wore it proudly back to work on the first day. The second day of work, I had a client meeting. That morning I felt compelled to shave it all off.<!--more-->

Was my perception wrong? Is it ok to be a little scruffy when meeting with clients? I usually dont worry about it with up to 3 or 4 days of facial hair.

I didn't really think too much more about it until I saw <a href="http://blog.flickr.com/en/2007/12/07/whiskerino-07/">this hilarious post</a> and set of pictures through the flickr blog - "<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/dubstyle/sets/72157602944817973/">Whiskerino '07</a>". What are your thoughts on the <a href="http://www.whiskerino.org/2007/about/">Whiskerino Manifesto</a> and wearing beards to work?
