At first they were unsure if they wanted to associate their brand with the application. Now they've gone full out! It's <a href="http://boston.going.com/bostongetnaughty">naughty gifts in real life</a>. They're hosting the naughty party in Boston on the day before halloween - the 30th October at 10pm. If you've got a flithy mind and like to party, this will be a killer event. Make sure to RSVP! Im going to be there. My interest is purely in how virtual communities can translate in to real communities and events ;)
