Some how I made it in there too! The <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0303/p13s03-wmgn.html">article is on coworking</a>, a practice I highly recommend for getting you out of the house and into a social environment. If anyone gets CSM in print, I'd love to get a physical copy of the article to put on the wall at <a href="http://betahouse.org">betahouse</a>
