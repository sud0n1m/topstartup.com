I'm even getting spam comments from people I know?!? Myspace is an orgiastic mess of spamminess. Myspace is a haven for everything that's wrong with the internet and social networks. 

From the obtrusive banner ads, to the painful layouts. It feels like when it was no longer cool to have your homepage on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocities">geocities</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelfire">angelfire</a> and it's going the way of the dodo. Sorry Tom, no more friends for you!
