They're a couple of Carnegie Mellon MBA candidates. They're in Boston for the summer as part of <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator's</a> really early stage seed program. Spending a summer in a tiny apartment in Cambridge in a group of four working everyday sounds fun!<!--more-->

The cool thing they're doing now is making it easy to stream high quality video. From their site
<blockquote>The SlapVid P2P video distribution platform is a Java applet that sits on the web-page and creates a peer-to-peer environment between all concurrent viewers of the same video. Each viewer will have a copy of the applet that will send and receive pieces of the video file to the other applets as need be. This reduces the amount of bandwidth coming from the real content servers, and can dramatically increase download speed.</blockquote>
