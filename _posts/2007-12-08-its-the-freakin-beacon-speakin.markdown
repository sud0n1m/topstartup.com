So here's how it works: 
<ol><li>Im signed in to facebook.</li><li>I then go on to yelp and add a review</li><li>Yelp infers who I am on facebook and sends a message to facebook that I have posted a new review</li><li>Next time I log in to facebook, I have the option to add that to my mini-feed.</li>

Personally I am not crazy about adding MORE lifestream data into facebook's clutches, but it's a slick implementation and a solid idea.

Enjoy the beacon!
