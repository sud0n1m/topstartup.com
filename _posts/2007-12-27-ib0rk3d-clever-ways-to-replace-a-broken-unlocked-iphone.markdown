<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/colin_n/2140899410/" title="Iphone error message by colin_n, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2272/2140899410_9f68729720_m.jpg" width="240" height="240" alt="Iphone error message" align="left"/></a>I declared gallantly that <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/09/13/icracked-my-iphone-unlocked-to-use-any-sim-card/">I had unlocked my iPhone</a>. It was great while it lasted. Then the phone stopped working. I guess am left with an Apple i or an iPod touch. As a natural born tinkerer, I decided to <a href="http://iphone.unlock.no/#how-to-downgrade-and-virginize-baseband">revirginize and reflash the phone to 1.1.1 and unlock again</a> (aside: Ben suggested that it would be great if you could revirginize people too). My first revirginizing effort was not a success. The software crashed while revirginizing. I tried a few different things. Eventually I was able to revirginize the phone. I got 1.1.1 back on there, unlocked again and voila! It worked.... for a few hours.<!--more-->

Now it gives me the wonderful message: 

<blockquote>
Repair Needed. iPhone cannot make or receive calls. www.apple.com/support

</blockquote>
I found an <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306846">apple support article</a>. Long story short... it's a hardware issue. Well on an unlocked phone, Im pretty sure I read that apple wont do jack.

So, I have a few options:
<ol>
	<li>Buy a brand new iPhone and unlock it</li>
	<li>Buy a brand new iPhone and sign up with AT&T</li>
	<li>Try to get Apple to replace my iPhone with a t-mobile sim card in it</li>
	<li>Revirginize and activate on AT&T, then try to exchange with Apple like I was on AT&T the whole time. Cancel AT&T or t-mobile after</li>
</ol>

Any suggestions?
