Where are we on that? Maybe a little behind schedule, but on the way. It's below freezing outside most days and often slushy. Hardly good biking weather. We had a stroke of good luck on the second last day of the year when we biked to Newport, Rhode Island. Ben and I are now training indoors on bicycle trainers. We even rearranged the living room so that we can bike and watch the tv. Now if only there was something good to watch!<!--more-->

Im working on getting sponsors and finding a great cause for us to ride in support of. We probably need to raise (or find?) around $6000 or so more to cover equipment and expenses.

I really can't wait to get outside and start biking. How tall are the rockies?

P.s. Milo can't come with us. He's the cat in the picture. Milo and his sister need a new home. Does anyone want two lovable kitties?
