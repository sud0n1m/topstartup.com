Topstartup has been sparse recently. Not necessarily because I am not blogging, more because I am really busy and blogging elsewhere:

<strong>Work</strong>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://virosity.com">Virosity blog</a> - the blog for my employer</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.good2gether.com">good2gether product blog</a> - the blog about new releases of good2gether, our current project</li>
</ul>
<strong>Fun</strong>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://bikeacrossthe.us">bikeacrossthe.us</a> - the blog (work in progress) about the upcoming cross country bike trip</li>
	<li><a href="http://colin.nederkoorn.co.uk">colin.nederkoorn.co.uk</a> - my tumble log. Short blog posts and cool things I come across on the web. This is the one place that aggregates everything I do on the interwebs, including this site.</li>
</ul>
Not to say that I won't be spending my time writing articles for Top Startup. I intend to post now more when I have something meaningful to say, rather than to keep to a schedule.
