Facebook continues to establish itself and gain a foothold in the online identity aggregation market. By that, I mean facebook is the most comprehensive place I can learn about my friends. As facebookers get superpoked, nerds with lofty ideals are trying to unseat Zuckerberg and Facebook.<!--more-->

I wrote a month ago about <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/09/19/zuckerbergs-garden-why-facebook-is-doomed-to-fail/">why facebook is doomed to fail</a>. Ironically, in that past month I've been building facebook applications! Part of my time has been spent figuring out how to get you and your data out of the chains that bind you on facebook and onto the broader internet. We're using the codename "Alien". Like in the image above, we want to burst out of Facebook's chest, rendering it dead.

There is some interesting discussion on the topic of <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/30/2138224">getting out of Facebook</a> on Slashdot. 

<strong>In the meantime...</strong>
<img src="http://img508.imageshack.us/img508/6663/zz2241fb9fzj4.jpg" alt="Facebook Sync" align="left"/>My personal favorite for getting info out of facebook is <a href="http://www.fsbsoftware.com/">FSB Software's Facebook Sync</a> (Mac only). This actually makes you updating your phone number useful to me. It will automatically sync with my address book. If you're on Windows or Linux, you can use <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/friendcsv/">FriendCSV to get your data outside of Facebook</a>. I tried it and wasn't too impressed. 

<strong>Colin is no longer on Facebook</strong>
What I'd really to develop is a permanent alternative where I can install the "Im No longer here" application and tell all my friends that my data is free, and I no longer use facebook. 

It will be a long time coming - expect 2 years from now or so, but it will happen.
