You know something is good when you discover it from two sources in one day. That's exactly what happened today. My mother recommended <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/">Dragons' Den</a> to me this morning and my business partner sent an email about it tonight.

<blockquote>... These people are very sharp, ruthless, tactless and sometimes downright ignorant. They see the bottom line immediately and tear people with seemingly solid inventions and businesses to shreds. On this side of the world this attitude is described positively as being able to "cut through the shit". While I personally dislike the manor of these types I find myself fascinated by them, most of whom have come from nothing and have very little education but just seem to have the knack for business.</blockquote>



Here's an episode from 2006. If you're outside the UK, you can sometimes find these episodes on Bittorrent. Apparently, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/dragonsden/">there is a Canadian version of this show too!</a>
