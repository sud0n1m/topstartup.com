Things will get better. Things WILL get better. You can keep wishing, clicking your heels, rubbing a rabbits tail. Whatever keeps the spirits at bay, keep doing that. The people who survive the next year, 2 years, 5 years... are the ones who have future-proofed their lives.

I'm going to focus mainly on tech, but these principles apply elsewhere too. In tech I can make a differentiation between hard skills and soft skills.
<table border="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Hard Skills</th>
<th>Soft Skills</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Engineers
Designers
Physical deliverable on the critical path</td>
<td>Product / Project Management
Marketing
Non-engineering founders</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
Drop yourself into a bucket. If you're on the "hard skills" side <em>and</em> you have a decent resume, congratulations! You might have to work for less money, but you should be able to find work.

But wait, you say "I have soft skills. I'm the <em>Chief Inspiration Officer</em>. I inspire people!<em></em>" You might be ok too. BUT, only if you did a lot of work in the years leading up to right now.

Here's where you should be:

<strong>1. You're a known voice</strong> in the conversation on your areas of interest. Think <a href="http://www.guykawasaki.com/">Guy Kawasaki</a>, <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann</a> or <a href="http://www.avc.com/">Fred Wilson</a>. If you're a known voice, people seek you out and will likely offer you a job, even in a down market (if you need one). Achieving this status is the highest form of social capital. I'm not in that position yet - but having my words online helps me with potential employers. All other things being equal someone with a industry related blog is better than someone without.

<strong>2. </strong>When you walk into an industry event, <strong>everyone knows you.</strong> Networking<strong> </strong>is a 24/7 activity. Take a look at your linked-in profile. Are 90% of the people there from your current employer? <strong>*gulp*</strong> That's not good. Those people can't help you if you get let go. If you started networking only <em>after</em> you lost your job, it's going to be a long uphill battle. People are wary of <em>what you want</em> from them. Meet people when you're in a position to help them and it's much easier to ask for their help or advice in the future.

<strong>3. Family</strong> is a last resort fall back. I'm extremely lucky that my Dad needs help at his business. If I get let go and can't find a job, he could always use my help. My parents would also feed me, and make sure I don't become homeless. If you don't have family to fall back on, then work extra hard networking while you still have a job. You don't have the last safety net.

Times are going to be tough but the strong will survive.

Will you?
