Unfortunately, the motivation we're using is largely a negative one: "I hope that it's not about me". It took an email from my friend Kristian to realize the full magnitude of how evil (and not in a good way) the app is.<!--more-->

When conceptualizing and developing applications, it's easy to get caught up in how to make things viral and sticky. A lot of facebook apps are stupid games. Beyond those, many successful facebook applications feed and grow little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcissus_(mythology)">narcissus</a> within us. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2433486906&b&ref=pd">Compare People</a>, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=2425101550">Top Friends</a> etc. The incentive for "comparing" or adding someone to "top friends" is the desire for them to reciprocate. That is what makes these viral.

So, with that said, I pose the following questions to anyone brave enough to answer:
<ol><li><strong>Can an application be viral without being innately selfish?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What applications of a social network like Facebook can provide a net gain to society?</strong></li>
</ol>
