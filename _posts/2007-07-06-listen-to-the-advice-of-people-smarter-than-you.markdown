I recently talked about Vishen at Mind Valley helping me <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/06/27/i-get-schooled-by-an-expert-in-site-design/">improve the traffic retention</a> on this blog. Well, I implemented Vishen's recommendations. As you can see the theme has been updated.

I included a sign up box in the top right, popular posts in a large footer at the bottom and a sign up box at the bottom again. I also made a few other changes to the theme. It's important to me that I have a good looking and functional site.

Im not ashamed to say that I used Ramit Sethi's <a href="http://iwillteachyoutoberich.com">I will teach you to be rich</a> as inspiration for some of the other changes.

Any other recommendations?
