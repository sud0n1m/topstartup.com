I attended the Open Coffee Club meeting in London today and met some very interesting and inspiring people. If you're thinking about starting up a business and you're in the London area, it's well worth a trip. I wish I could go next week, but I'll be back in Boston. Expect to see me at the meet in Boston!

<h3>London's entrepreneur scene</h3>
London's scene is full of activity, and talking with people at the Open Coffee Club, it seems it's getting better. The main problem with London is the cost of everything here. My train ticket in from Ascot during peak time was $45. It's cheaper for me to take a 4 hr bus ride to New York and back than it is to get into London for the day!

Since the internet levels the playing field, this means that the hurdles to getting an internet business off the ground are much higher. With current exchange rates, your idea basically has to be twice as good!
