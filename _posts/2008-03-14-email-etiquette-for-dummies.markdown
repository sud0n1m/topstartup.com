The father of an old girlfriend of mine and I were discussing email etiquette. He is the President of a large pharmaceutical company. I asked him how he dealt with the volume of email that I assumed he received.

He told me that he asks people to follow a few simple rules when sending him email. These seem obvious, but Im amazed at how many people don't know them. <!--more-->

<strong>To:</strong> Adding an email address to the To field implies you want the person to <em>take action</em>. Either they owe you a response, or they need to act on some instruction in the email.

<strong>CC: </strong>Implies that the email is for information only. No action is necessary

<strong>BCC:</strong> Best used for large lists. If you're sending to a lot of people, don't have 50 people in the CC list. Invariably someone will click "reply all" and send uninteresting information to everyone!

Additionally, if forwarding a message where there is only one person in the "To:" field, you can modify the subject line to say "NRN" at the beginning. This tells the recipient there is "No Response Necessary".

As email volume increases day by day, simple methods can help us stay sane.

Send these helpful tips to the worst offenders you know.
