Damn that <a href="http://ben.casnocha.com/2007/06/how_to_be_a_bet.html">Ben Casnocha</a> for being <a href="http://ben.casnocha.com/2007/06/how_to_be_a_bet.html">so insightful AGAIN</a>. His blog helped me understand something about my blog. I don't like my writing style! I got it through Ben Casnocha, but the <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html">original advice</a> came from Scott Adams (the <a href="http://dilbert.com/">Dilbert</a> guy).<!--more-->

A couple of Scott Adams' tips are below, but I recommend you check out <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/the_dilbert_blog/2007/06/the_day_you_bec.html">his post for the full whack</a>:
<blockquote>Business writing is about clarity and persuasion. The main technique is keeping things simple. Simple writing is persuasive. A good argument in five sentences will sway more people than a brilliant argument in a hundred sentences. Donâ€™t fight it.

Simple means getting rid of extra words. Donâ€™t write, â€œHe was very happyâ€ when you can write â€œHe was happy.â€ You think the word â€œveryâ€ adds something. It doesnâ€™t. Prune your sentences.

Humor writing is a lot like business writing. It needs to be simple. The main difference is in the choice of words. For humor, donâ€™t say â€œdrinkâ€ when you can say â€œswill.â€

Write short sentences. Avoid putting multiple thoughts in one sentence. Readers arenâ€™t as smart as youâ€™d think.</blockquote>
Im trying to be a better writer! Cheers to self-improvement.
