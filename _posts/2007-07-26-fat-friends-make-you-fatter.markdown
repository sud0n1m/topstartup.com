<blockquote>...if someoneâ€™s friend becomes obese, that personâ€™s chances of becoming obese increase by more than half.
<p class="textBodyBlack"><span id="byLine"></span>Siblings and spouses also have an influence, although a reduced one â€” people whose siblings became obese were themselves 40 percent more likely to grow obese, while people whose spouses became obese were 37 percent more likely to.</p>
</blockquote>
To me it makes sense. We mirror ourselves on what we see in our friends. Let's take that a little further:
<ul>
	<li>Lazy friends make you lazier?</li>
	<li>Rich friends make you richer?</li>
	<li>Smart friends make you smarter?</li>
</ul>
So, here's my recommendation:<!--more-->
<strong>Surround yourself with the people you want to be most like
</strong>

Im lucky that I'm involved with BetaHouse, my co-working space. Being around smart, talented entrepreneurs has opened my eyes to opportunities.

In the past, when I spent time with my friend Kristian, I would get in better shape because he would invite me to go running.

The people with whom you surround yourself can have a positive or negative impact on your life. If they are having a negative impact, get rid of them.
