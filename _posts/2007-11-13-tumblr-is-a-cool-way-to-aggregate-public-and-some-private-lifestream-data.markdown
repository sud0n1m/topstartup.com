<img src="http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/2747/zz26026f98ro6.jpg" alt="Tumblr Logo" align="left"/>I've got this blog, I've got <a href="http://pintmaster.com">pintmaster.com</a>, I've got a <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/sudonim">picasaweb account</a>. It's a confusing mess! I've got lots of "stuff" I <em>need</em> to share with friends. Granted, i've got my rel=me links in the sidebar. But, giving you guys that stuff to do something with isn't enough. We're all lazy. We want someone or something else to do the heavy lifting. In comes <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a><!--more-->

<h3>It's what they've left out that makes it cool</h3>
Beyond aggregating my personal streams, what makes <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a> cool is that they've made a determination on the things that people like to share with each other:

Each content item is more structured than my blog. For example, in my blog, every <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a> content type falls under one thing. I like that I can post a quote without feeling the need to write a blog post around it. I've got my iPhone rigged now, so I can snap a picture and mail it to <a href="http://colin.nederkoorn.co.uk">my tumblr page</a>. 

<h3>Cool privacy</h3>
<img src="http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/4941/zz023f9eaejm4.jpg" alt="Tumblr channels" align="left" /><a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a> has cool privacy in the form of channels. I can specifically allow or deny access to channels based on email addresses. I think it might require people to join though - which is a little bit of a bummer. I've got a music channel which has links to cool stuff that I've heard recently. It's only for friends because Im not sure if I can share it. It's not an oink.cd replacement, but if you want in, let me know!

<h3>tumblr vs. twitter</h3>
Twitter still has it's place. <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a> is not there yet in terms of social interaction. There are a lot of back and forth conversations on twitter now. <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a> still feels very one way. Maybe because aside from Brian Del Vecchio, I am practically alone there.

<h3>Thumbs up</h3>
So, <a href="http://tumblr.com">tumblr</a> rocks. I've got it working in <a href="http://blog.circlesixdesign.com/download/moodswing">moodblast</a> and Im going to continue to use it. If you want more than just the topstartup.com content, you can check out (almost) everything I'm putting online at: <a href="http://colin.nederkoorn.co.uk">colin.nederkoorn.co.uk</a>. Im sure my first couple of hours on tumblr only scratch the surface of what's there. Expect more in the future.
