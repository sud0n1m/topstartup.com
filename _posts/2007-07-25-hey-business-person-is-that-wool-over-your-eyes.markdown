Without us developers, this project would be dead". Are you going to sit there and be ignorant to the mysteries of development? Or are you going to learn something about it?<!--more-->

<strong>Think on your developers wavelength.</strong> Read <a HREF="http://slashdot.org">Slashdot</a>. Make sure to check out the comments. You'll start to learn how geeks communicate. Make small talk with developers about the cool things you learn.

<strong>Earn your geek stripes on the command line</strong>. If you've got a mac, great! Just fire up Terminal, and do a <a HREF="http://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=os+x+terminal">search for commands to try</a> on google. Otherwise, get even geekier. <a HREF="http://vmware.com/products/player/">Download Vmware</a> and install linux!

<strong>For the more adventurous</strong>, set up your own development server running linux, subversion, trac, RoR.Â That's what I've been doing over the past few days.

Shed your old skin. Be a <em>biz</em>veloper!
