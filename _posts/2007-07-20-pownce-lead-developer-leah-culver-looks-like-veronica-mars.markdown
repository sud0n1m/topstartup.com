Check out the picture below. Kevin Rose's lead developer for <a href="http://www.pownce.com">Pownce</a>, <a href="http://leahculver.com/">Leah Culver</a> <strong>is</strong> Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell) <em>minus</em> detective skills and <em>plus</em> computer skills. What skills would you use to win her?<!--more-->

My friend Kristian is obsessed with Kristen Bell. He watches Veronica Mars with the sound off. He did however ignore my invitation to join Pownce (jerk). The thing i'm not quite sure of is why Leah wears sunglasses in all of her profile pictures?
