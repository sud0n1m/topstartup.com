Now is a great time to leave your current job and get into tech. If you've been thinking about it, If you've been wondering "when should I start my business", or "when should I apply for jobs at a startup?". The answer is now<!--more-->

Here's a laundry list of why:

<ol>
	<li>A friend of mine at a Venture Capital firm told me that in the first half of 2007, Boston based web startups had more investment than San Francisco based startups. I think the balance may have changed with the facebook $740 million</li>
	<li>I spoke with a recruiter recently who told me companies are doing significant hiring at the moment</li>
	<li>Companies are getting investment based on ideas without a product yet</li>
	<li>Investors are giving companies crazy valuations again (Facebook $15 billion valuation)</li>
<li>The cost to start a web company compared to 7 years ago is relatively small (ruby on rails, amazon ec2 & s3, slicehost)</li>
	<li>People are attending local entrepreneurship and technology events like never before - if you're in boston, check out <a href="http://www.marksguide.com">Marks Guide for upcoming events</a></li>
</ol>

All of these combined make the time ripe for starting a company or getting into a Web 2.0 startup. When are you starting your business?
