This goes for your business and your life. Upon a recommendation from <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/06/27/i-get-schooled-by-an-expert-in-site-design/">Vishen at Mind Valley</a>, I was relying on <a href="http://zookoda.com">Zookoda</a> for this site's email list. Rather than build and maintain the software myself, I relied on their skilled programmers and support staff to do it for me.Â  <!--more-->

Well, <a href="http://zookoda.com">Zookoda</a> is down right now, and that was causing my blog to not load correctly. <a href="http://zookoda.com">Zookoda</a> wants you to load Javascript from their site to embed the sign up form. When <a href="http://zookoda.com">Zookoda</a> goes down, so do you.

In general, it's much better to rely on others (I rely on <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress</a> for my blogging platform). It is my responsibility however to make sure the site stays up. With that in mind, Im going to look for an alternative mailing list application that allows me to maintain it. Any recommendations?
