I was at a Microsoft launch event in Houston and I met with a guy from <a href="http://netprosys.com/">NetProSys</a>, a global outsourcing firm. Every time you approached a booth at the conference the company in the booth would scan your badge for a prize drawing. The prize was usually a Zune (no iPods allowed) or something like that. Well, Im aware of the odds of winning a prize at a conference (or lottery) so I dont pay any attention to them. Well, I was in luck! From an email received tonight:

<blockquote>...you have won one of the five prizes we were offering at the raffle. In the first round of drawings only 2 winners showed up to claim their prizes, afterwards we conducted the drawing again and your name came up as one of the winners for â€œFree $4,000 worth of Software Development Services** â€?.</blockquote>

Internally, we've been discussing integrating a global outsourcing firm into non-critical-path development for our company in order to keep the core development team lean and mean. It's really exciting to have a trial opportunity to test it out.

Im going to be going to the <a href="http://netprosys.com/">NetProSys</a> offices in March to meet and discuss how we would like to use our prize!
