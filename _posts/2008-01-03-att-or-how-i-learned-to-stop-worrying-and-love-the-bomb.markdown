For those who don't get the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/">Dr. Strangelove</a> reference, you need to see that movie.

Today, I replaced my <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/12/27/ib0rk3d-clever-ways-to-replace-a-broken-unlocked-iphone/">b0rk3d hacked iPhone</a> with a new one from Apple. Here's how I did it.<!--more-->
<ol>
	<li>Put the AT&amp;T sim card back in the phone</li>
	<li>Restore the iPhone to 1.1.2</li>
	<li>Get pre-auth code from an AT&amp;T store (if needed)</li>
	<li>Activate on AT&amp;T

	<li>Whoops, it looks like the phone functionality needs to work to activate

	<li>Make an appointment with the Apple Store</li>
	<li>Say something like - "I bought it a while ago but it's been in the box"</li>
	<li>Get replacement phone (now activated)</li>
	<li>Return home with new iPhone</li>
</ol>
At this point, you can choose whether or not you want to stick with AT&amp;T, or go back to your old provider. I decided to give them a shot and port my number over. Here's why:
<ul>
	<li>There is a delay in getting new features on a hacked phone</li>
	<li>Recracking the phone after each update is a pain</li>
	<li>Visual voicemail seems cool?</li>
	<li>The cost saving on t-mobile was $10 a month (after the $175 cancellation fee).</li>
	<li>The hassle factor of being wholly responsible for the well-being of my phone is annoying.</li>
	<li>I can always crack it again if I want to use it overseas on someone other than AT&amp;T</li>
</ul>
Time will tell if this was the right decision!
