It seems that if you want to make it big, you move out to San Francisco. Facebook did it. Heck, my friend Lee moved from New York to San Francisco for eLifeList.com. In spring 2008, Im going out to San Francisco. Then I'm coming back to Boston.<!--more-->

<strong>This is my declaration of intent:</strong>

Im going to bike across the United States. I'll go from coast to coast. San Francisco to Boston.  I'll do it in Spring 2008 with at least my friend and roommate Ben Winterroth.

Im excited at the prospect of pushing the limit of my physical endurance. Training started yesterday, and I can't wait to do it.

We're going to need a lot of help. Your encouragement is definitely welcome. So are any sponsorship opportunities!
