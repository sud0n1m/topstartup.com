A few of us went down from Boston. Me, <a href="http://www.marksguide.com">Mark Doerschlag</a>, <a href="http://www.linkspank.com">Andrew Mitchell</a> and <a href="http://fafarazzi.com/">Todd Galloway</a>.  I hate to love Jason Fried. His and 37Signals philosophies align with mine. Use beautiful tools to create beautiful, simple things.  Get rid of <em>all</em> the bullshit  and focus on what's really important to you and your customers.<!--more-->

I've <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/07/20/37-signals-doesnt-understand-web-20/">criticised 37signals in the past</a>, but must concede that software design is better off because of them.

37Signals flipped the software design process on its head. Start by using sharpies to draw an interface on paper. From there, start coding the HTML for the site. Iterate out until you have a finished product. You can read more about this process in their e-book <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a>.

They develop exclusively on <a href="http://rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a> (RoR). 37Signals <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/">David Heinemeier Hansson</a> (or DHH as he is known in the community) originally conceived and developed Rails. My current company Notati, built our <a href="http://www.prayabout.com">Prayer Request</a> social network, <a href="http://www.prayabout.com">Prayabout</a> on Rails. Rails also powers <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/04/18/get-your-companys-website-up-and-running-part-2-powering-the-website/">Radiant, a CMS I highly recommend</a>.
