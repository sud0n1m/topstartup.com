Our client, <a href="http://good2gether.com">good2gether</a> presented as one of three "main dish" presenters. Im thrilled for <a href="http://good2gether.com">good2gether</a> and thrilled for <a href="http://virosity.com">Virosity</a>. We won the Audience Choice award!

After months of working on <a href="http://good2gether.com">good2gether</a>, it's exciting to have several hundred industry peers voting (by cell phone) for the product we (Virosity and good2gether) built!
