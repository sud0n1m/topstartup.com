Aside from the free drinks, many of us were there to see what this Bug Device does and what the company is all about.

<strong>Here's the gist:  </strong>
BUG: An open source, web-enabled, modular software + hardware platform.<!--more-->

Whaaaaa? let me rephrase that. BUG is lego for tech geeks. You can swap in and swap out different components to make the BUG be what you want it to be. GPS, motion sensors, touch screen LCD. These guys are trying to make the ultimate consumer / prosumer customizable device.

When is the last time you thought about reprogramming your GPS to take pictures every 100 ft you travel. With a BUG, you "could" do that. The interesting thing for me will be when other people figure out cool things to do. I'm great at following walk-throughs on how to do cool things, but I'm not going to hack into a BUG to build my own custom devices. I want a device that will turn on my favorite music when I walk from room to room. Or start the coffee pot when I start to wake up.

The BUG could be the beginning of a revolution towards end-user built hardware devices. These will enrich and empower our lives in ways we have not thought of yet. It's a great start. I don't think the BUG <em>is </em> that revolution quite yet. Let's wait and see when it comes out at the end of this year.
