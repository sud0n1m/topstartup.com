I did it! I unlocked the iPhone. I'm running t-mobile and it was all done with software. <!--more-->

On Tuesday I was thinking to myself that I should really get an iPhone. I get annoyed trying to sync my Blackberry to my Mac. Not everything transfers properly. With the iPhone, everything will be smooth. I enviously gazed at Dan Choi's iPhone during the day and thought about getting one in the next few days. I gave my roommate Ben a call as I was leaving work. He said "Guess what?". What? "I got an iPhone! It rocks." I thought to myself "this is meant to be. Im getting one now". I told him I would be home in a few and swung by AT&amp;T - just steps from the office.

$399+ tax later, I walked out with my iPhone.

Before there was<a href="http://www.freeiphoneunlock.com/unlock/"> a snazzy installer</a>, Ben and I spent the evening going through the step by step process to unlock our iphones

5:45 pm - I arrive home
6:45 pm - I purchase an unlock key from one of iPhoneSimFree resellers
6:47 pm - Ben tells me we're on the verge of a free alternative!
7:30 pm - We throw on James Bond - Live &amp; Let Die
7:56 pm - <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/11/early-iphone-sim-unlock-open-source-code-released/ ">Sim unlock source code released</a>
9:00 pm - Application released &amp; Ben and I start looking at how to do it
10:30 pm - I copy a file over that causes my iPhone to freeze!
11:05 - I fix it
12:15 pm - My iPhone unlocked

I'm now running the iPhone on t-mobile using my blackberry unlimited data plan (wap.voicestream.com , no user / pass to get on the data network). It rocks. Is anyone else out there running an unlocked iPhone?
