You can watch Greg and Brian's 6 minute presentation live.

Make sure you <a href="http://www.demo.com/">register at the DEMO website</a>. Mark your calendars! Greg and Brian will be on stage on <strong>Wednesday, January 30th 10:45am PST </strong>(1:45pm EST). We'll probably have it projected on the wall at <a href="http://betahouse.org">BetaHouse</a>. Let me know if you'd like to come. This is a big deal for us, and we're really excited to get a sneak peak out to the world.
