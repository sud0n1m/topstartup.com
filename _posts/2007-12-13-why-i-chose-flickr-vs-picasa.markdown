After arriving back from Argentina, I realized if I were to upload my pictures to Picasa Web Albums, I would very quickly run out of space.

Michelle who was on my trip had her photos on flickr and my friend Brian in Betahouse used flickr. So, I decided to give it a shot. I love it and wouldnt switch back.<!--more-->
<h3>Price</h3>
Flickr and Google charge differently for their service. Flickr is $24.99 for all you can eat. Google charges you depending on how many GB you want to have. They apply this storage across all google services you use. 10 gb on Google costs $20 per year. I may not use more than 10 gb in my first year with flickr, but eventually I probably will.

<h3>Features</h3>
Flickr is much more social than google web albums. It's more of a community. As far as features, flickr is the market leader. Google may get a good foothold with PicasaWeb, but flickr is number one in this space.

Flickr just added stats. Now I can see how many people are looking at my photos and which ones they are looking at. How cool is that?

I don't want to make this a long rant, but I was interested by my inclination to pay more for all-you-can-eat when with all likelyhood, I could have saved my 4.99, if I was just looking for someone to host pictures online.
