I believe that in general, charities have too much waste. I attended a charity event called "Linus bats for kids". The event took place at Fenway Park and was in support of Horizons for Homeless Children. According to Charity Navigator, <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=9400">Horizons for Homeless Children</a> is a pretty decent charity. That makes me happier since I gave them money<!--more-->

To me it appeared that 90% of the people at the event were in their 20s and 30s. That's really a great sign. It might have been the open bar that convinced people. Im not sure. All in all, my first charity event was a positive experience and I'm going to get more involved. I've been waiting (for 2 weeks) to hear back from <a href="http://icouldbe.org/">icouldbe.org</a> for a mentoring position. Maybe Big Brothers has their act more together than icouldbe.org.

I'm excited that in the future (1q 2008), organizations like Horizons for Homeless Children will have a lower cost to get their message heard about their organization and events. They'll lower their cost to make an impact on you and on me. Im excited that I'll be part of that.

Im glad to say that my cynicism about charity events and charities is diminished. It still bothers me a dollar donated does not equal a dollar of difference due to overheads but I'm getting a little softer on my stance.
