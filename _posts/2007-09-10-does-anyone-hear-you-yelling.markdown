Wave your arms? Take your pants off? How do you get attention?

Simplify the message. Cut to the core and get rid of the excess. <!--more-->One memorable example of an idea designed to stick is <a href="http://www.snopes.com/horrors/poison/halloween.asp">poisoned halloween candy</a>. This is an urban legend that seems to spread (now by email) every Halloween. This hoax has been around for 30 years. Talk about sticky!

It's always easier said than done, but there are some great examples and a bunch of tips in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400064287/105-7279884-3758821?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=onmacnet-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=1400064287">Made To Stick</a> by Chip Heath and Dan Heath. Have you read the book? I'd love to hear what you think.
