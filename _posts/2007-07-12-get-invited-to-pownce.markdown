I've got five whole invites to Pownce, Kevin Rose's new project. It's a cool app built on Adobe's AIR. The idea is to extend what twitter does a little further. Twitter is basically public status messages. Pownce aims to give you more control about how public you make messages, links, files and events.

Kevin Rose's godlike status in the geek world will likely give it that.
