Kevin is the founder and man behind <a href="http://digg.com">Digg.com</a> , the 106th most popular site on the net (<a href="http://www.alexa.com/data/details/main?q=&amp;url=http://digg.com">according to alexa</a>).<!--more-->

It was interesting to meet a guy like Kevin Rose whom I have only ever seen on the other side of a screen - like on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechTV">Tech TV</a> or <a href="http://revision3.com/diggnation/">Diggnation</a>. He always looks so calm and confident when he is in front of a camera.Â  When I met him I noticed that it seemed like a nervous experience for him to interact with strangers. It's probably an awkward feeling when other people know more about you than you do about them.
