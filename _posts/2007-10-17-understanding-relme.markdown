There's a geeky little HTML tag that's gaining some traction. <strong>rel="me"</strong>. You add it to links on your blog / homepage that are links to other identities of yours on the web.

I've added it to my "Get Social" section on the sidebar. <strong>The post-facebook internet starts with this little tag</strong>. Through it, you can identify me on all the sites I use around the web. If you can learn about me through those sites (or a mashup) without going to facebook, why use facebook?<!--more-->

<h4>The secret formula</h4>
1. Add rel="me" to every website and individual
2. ....... (there's stuff in my head to fill in #2)
3. Profit!

Granted, rel="me" doesn't provide any immediate benefit. It does however put the infrastructure in place to replace little walled zuckerberg gardens with vast, beautiful, digital rainforests.
