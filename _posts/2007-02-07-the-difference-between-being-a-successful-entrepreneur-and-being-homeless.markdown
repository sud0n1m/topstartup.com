I try to run at least 3 times per week. Running is a great way for me to clear my head and evaluate my next plan of attack. On my running route through Eleanor Tinsley park, I generally pass around 3 - 5 homeless people. Being newly unemployed, I got to thinking about their situations and what led up to them being homeless. At some point, they too were without a job and had to make a decision on what to do next.

First of all, I was thinking about the similarities between myself and a homeless person:
<ol>
	<li>We don't know from where our next dollar will come</li>
	<li>We're required to use our wits to find food to eat</li>
	<li>The only one responsible for our success or failure is ourself</li>
</ol>
Clearly there are many things that I share in common with the homeless men and women that I see on my run. I got to thinking if I would allow myself to be in that situation. As I ran, I thought more about myself and why I am different. In my mind, Im already a successful entrepreneur. I have a defined vision of the world I seek to create. Every minute of every day I take steps towards that vision. 

I am aware that homelessness is largely caused by drug & alcohol abuse, mental illness, and sometimes pure bad luck. Here are some of the traits that prevent homelessness from happening to entrepreneurs.

<ol>
	<li>You create your own luck. If you believe good things to happen to you, they will.</li>
	<li>You are dedicated and committed to improving your life and the life of those around you. You help people with no expectation of compensation</li>	
	<li>You look for opportunities in the world around you and find ways to do things better</li>
	<li>You are inspired and you inspire others. People are magnetically drawn to you and want to be involved in what you are doing</li>
	<li>You see failure as another opportunity to learn something new. If something isnt working, you cut your losses and try again</li>
</ol>

You may not embody all of these traits. Take note, that the positive traits, I directed at "you", the reader. Since you are at this site, you are already taking steps to give yourself the edge required to compete in todays global market place. Remember - being an entrepreneur is as much about fixing your flaws as it is about being born with the right stuff. 

The only pre-requisite to success in my book is being able to evaluate your behavior in a detached manner and change the things keeping success out of your reach. Recognizing and compensating for your faults is the difference between being a successful entrepreneur and being homeless.
