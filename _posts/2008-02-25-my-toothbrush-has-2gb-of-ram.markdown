How many products can you count that have not been replaced by newer, better ones? Is it possible to reach the limit where you cannot make a better widget? or hammer? or bicycle seat?

Maybe.<!--more-->

But so far, we're not there yet. The best bicycle seats money can buy have been made by <a href="http://brookssaddles.com">Brooks Saddles</a> pretty much the same way since 1866. Their flagship model for first appeared in the 1898 catalog! Sure, the process has probably been improved, but the widget is pretty much the same.

I first learned about brooks saddles through people who have been <a href="http://www.downtheroad.org/Equipment/Bike_Parts/bicycle_touring_saddles.htm">touring the world by bike since 2002</a>. They have much more experience than me and claimed it is the best bike seat. The people at the bike shop agree. When I asked a guy "would you ride across the country if you weren't using your brooks saddle?" He said no.

In a world where newer is better. It's refreshing to see something old be the best there is.
