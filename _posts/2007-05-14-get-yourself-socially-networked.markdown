Social networking is not just about pretending you're a lesbian on myspace. There are many good reasons to stay networked. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Dunbar's number</a> (which for the record is 150), is the "maximum number of individuals with whom a set of people can maintain a social relationship".

Relationships take time and energy. With the internet, we can maintain relationships with friends across the far reaches of the globe. Centralized social networks such as facebook, myspace and linked-in allow you to keep large groups of people connected to you. Your friends can read about your interactions with other friends and keep up to date with your goings on. Blogs, such as this one take that connection to the next level. In this blog, I share my thoughts, feelings and ideas with a large audience. Through my blog, you know me. If you read other peoples blogs, that's a great way to meet others with similar interests. Check out a couple of <a href="http://cpptrader.com/2007/05/09/options-fundamentals-trading-mispricings/">my</a>  <a href="http://www.devspace.com/~christianhgross/?p=300/#comments">comments</a> on other blogs. These have both sparked <a href="http://cpptrader.com/2007/05/14/option-arbitrage-using-synthetics/">personal</a> <a href="http://www.devspace.com/~christianhgross/?p=302">responses</a>, and potential new relationships to add to my network!

So, keep reading, whether on my facebook feed or on this blog! I look forward to learning about what you're doing and hope that we can help each other in the future.
