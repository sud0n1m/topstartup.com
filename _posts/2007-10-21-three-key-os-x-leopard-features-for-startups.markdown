<ol>
<li><strong>Time Machine</strong> - One of the features Apple is pushing hard for this release. Time machine is document versioning for your entire system. You do need to have an external drive for it to work, but once you do, you will never lose a document by accident. Time machine makes document backup and recovery easy.</li><!--more-->
<li><strong>iChat screen sharing</strong> - If you have an office standardized on Apple, you get a huge benefit from being able to share presentations, do video conferencing and more. If only it supported the protocols that AdiumX does, it would be useful!</li>
<li><strong>Other minor improvements</strong> - This release is not a quantum leap forward, but there are a lot of changes that add additional usability. Spaces, Quick Look, Stacks on the desktop</li>

Im installing it next weekend. I'll put a full review up when I have Leopard up and running.
