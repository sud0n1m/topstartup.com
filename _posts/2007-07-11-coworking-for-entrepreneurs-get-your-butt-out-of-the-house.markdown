Dev House is a fantastic one day event to bring a bunch of talented programmers together to do cool things in the space of a day. I worked on a team to build the very buggy <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/pairmatch">Pairmatch</a> facebook application. The event was held in a <a href="http://coworking.pbwiki.com/">coworking</a> space on Magazine St. in Cambridge.<!--more-->
<h3>What is Co-Working?</h3>
The co-working wiki has the following definition
<blockquote>Coworking is cafe-like community/collaboration space for developers, writers and independents.
Or, it's like this: start with a shared office and add cafe culture. Which is the opposite of most modern cafes. ;)</blockquote>
Im going to define it as: <strong>Like minded people sharing office space to accelerate productivity and maximize sanity</strong>

I was intrigued by this concept. Sticking a bunch of web startup entrepreneurs in one place. Brilliant! I decided that I had to get involved. After a rigorous interview process, I was accepted into the Co-Working Loft on Magazine St.

Im now spending my days at the loft working hard on a multitude of projects. Being here has given me access to expertise and ideas that sitting at home did not. It has also opened up opportunities for collaboration (more about that in a few days). I'd love to hear if you're co-working. How has your experience been?

Here are some pictures of the space:
