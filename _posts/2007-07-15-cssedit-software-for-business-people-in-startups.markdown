This is the first in a series of software for business people in startups.

<strong>Use Case:  </strong>You've outsourced the design of your startup site to a professional design firm (you're smart enough to know not to hire an in-house designer yet). The website has a small change that needs to be made. You can either pay your design firm $500 to make the change, or do it yourself. <!--more-->

<strong>Tools:  </strong><a href="http://www.macrabbit.com/cssedit/">CSS Edit from MacRabbit</a>
<strong>Platform: </strong>Mac Only
<strong>Cost:</strong> $29.95
<h3>What is CSS?</h3>
Modern websites have 95% of their styling done in CSS, Cascading Style Sheets. With CSS, you can change the colors, font size, and even the position of elements on the page.
<h3>I can't do that, Im a business person!</h3>
<a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/07/15/cssedit-software-for-business-people-in-startups/css-edit/" rel="attachment wp-att-135" title="CSS Edit"><img src="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/css-edit.thumbnail.jpg" title="CSS Edit" alt="CSS Edit" align="left" /></a>That's just not true.
<ul>
	<li> CSS Edit lets you preview a site on the internet in real time. I can try different variations on google.com or cnn.com if I want.</li>
	<li>CSS edit will show you what tag to change by clicking on a part of the page.</li>
	<li>CSS Edit also gives you the list of options for each tag.
<ul>
	<li>When you make a change you can see it updated instantly</li>
	<li>You haven't changed anything online yet, so you cant screw up the site!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
I recommend you give it a shot and try playing around with Google.com to see how CSS Edit works. You'll see how easy it is to use!

Once you're well funded, sit back and relax. You can hire someone to do make updates! Until then, CSS Edit makes styling a website easy for less technical folk.

<strong>Edit:</strong> There is a free tool with a little less gloss. It's called <a href="http://www.getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> and it integrates in with Firefox. It will work on Windows, Mac and Linux.
