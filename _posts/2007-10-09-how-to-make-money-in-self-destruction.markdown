"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHope-They-Serve-Beer-Hell%2Fdp%2F0806527285%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1191936751%26sr%3D8-1&amp;tag=topstartup-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">I hope they serve beer in hell</a>" by <a href="http://www.tuckermax.com/">Tucker Max</a>. This guy has made a (writing) career for himself out of screwing things up. Incredible!  His stories of debauchery are really amusing and a great easy read. Most revolve around drunkenness, sex, defecation. They aren't for the faint of heart.  Read on for a passage from the book.<!--more-->

Here's one of the few PGish passages from the book where one of the partners at the law firm at which he is interning is trying to have sex with him:
<blockquote>We get to the firm, and Brian and I get out of Sally's car, and then she turns off the car and gets out herself. She looks up at the building (Fenwick has all of a ten story building in Palo Alto), then looks right at me and says, "It looks like I left the lights on in my office. I should probably go turn them off. What do you think?" I am oblivious to the implied meaning here, and look up and say, "Whatever, who cares--they're halogen, it'll cost like 3 cents for the night. Forget it."

Sally gets a mildly frustrated look on her face, and still staring right at me, says, "I need to go up to my office and turn off my lights. Maybe you should come up there...help me out." Did I ever mention how retarded I am when I get drunk? Well, I missed that signal too, "No, whatever, they're fine, don't worry about it." She kind of pauses for a second, looks right into my eyes, and says, "DO YOU...want to come...HELP ME...turn off the lights...IN MY OFFICE?"</blockquote>
