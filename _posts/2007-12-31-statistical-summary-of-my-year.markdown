Number of times I moved: 4
Number of companies with which I had a full time job: 4 (incl. my own company)
Amount of time spent away from home (wherever that was): 3 months
Countries Visited: 4 (not counting transits)
Distance Flown: 80,872 mi
Longest Bike Ride: 73 mi
Longest Car Trip: 1,845 mi

Being unsettled created an amazing amount of stress for me in 2007. However, I couldn't be happier where the year is ending. The bike ride statistic was accomplished yesterday when Ben and I biked from our place in Cambridge to Newport, Rhode Island. Im a little sore, but dancing tonight should loosen me up. See you next year!
