If you browse the site on your iPhone or using <a href="http://www.marketcircle.com/iphoney/">iPhoney</a>, you should see a <a href="http://iwphone.contentrobot.com/">site optimized for the iPhone</a>. For such a small market, there sure are a lot of people investing time into the iPhone. I wonder how many users the iPhone has vs. the Blackberry?
