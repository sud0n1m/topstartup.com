I've never liked wires. I am, however, a nerd with a lot of gadgets. I get rid of things, make them smaller or make them wireless when I can. I just redid my Keyboard and Mouse situation.

This is my desktop up until today. My massive microsoft bluetooth keyboard and mouse were spilling off of the keyboard tray and it was super annoying.

<strong>After</strong>

Now, I've replaced it with an Apple Wireless Keyboard and Mighty Mouse. I've even got space to throw the charger to my iPhone on the keyboard tray.

Clearer desk, clearer mind.
