The gift for October 25th, a unicorn is set to a limit of 10,000,000 before it sells out. So, based on facebook's october user numbers of 47,000,000 users, you have about a one in five chance of getting this stupid unicorn sent to you before stock runs out.<!--more-->

Assuming Facebook sells out of these gifts, and all purchasers buy them using the bulk discount ($5 for 10 gifts), facebook will take in a cool $5,000,000 (that's $5 million for those bad with zeroes).

Does this kind of thing justify the rumored <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/facebook-taps-into-hedge-funds-for-500-million-more/">500 million in investment that facebook just got</a> on top of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/">Microsoft's $240 million facebook investment</a>?
