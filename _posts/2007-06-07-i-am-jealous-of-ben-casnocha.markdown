The guy is 19 and just finished writing a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0787996130%26tag=topstartup-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0787996130%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02"><img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/I/01hwNuB3TPL.jpg" align="right" /></a>"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0787996130%26tag=topstartup-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0787996130%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">My Start-up Life</a>". He started his first venture when he was 14. I think it is great that it's possible in the US for young people like Casnocha to become a CEO of a business at such a young age. Casnocha started a company called <a href="http://www.comcate.com/">Comcate</a> to provide "a better way for city governments to communicate with constituents on the Web".

Casnocha is a great inspiration to the rest of us. His story is extraordinary. I'd love to be in his shoes right now, but Im not quite there yet. I can't help but feel a little bit of jealousy for Ben Casnocha, and a twinge of inferiority that he was able to do it at a younger age! Put that all aside, there are some valuable lessons to learn.
