<a href="http://www.lunabar.com"><img src="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/luna_bar.thumbnail.png" title="Luna Bar" alt="Luna Bar" align="right" />Luna Bars</a> are protein bars targeted at women. On the bar it reads "The Whole Nutrition Bar <em>for </em>Women". They also have great flavors. Chocolate Pecan Pie, Dulce de Leche, Lemon Zest, Chai Tea, Chocolate Peppermint stick. <!--more-->Those names make me want to eat a luna. I'd never tried them until yesterday.

They're pretty good! I would eat them again. It made me wonder something. Why do they target their marketing to women? Is it better to risk excluding a gender from your product to capture a larger market share of women or men?
