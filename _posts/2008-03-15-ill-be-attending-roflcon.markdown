... because entrepreneurs need to have fun too! <a href="http://roflcon.org/">ROFLcon</a> is a conference all about internet culture and memes. Last night I cracked. I bit the bullet and signed up while at a bar on my iPhone. If you have no idea about these types of things, you've probably missed out on the following:<!--more-->
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/">Homestar Runner</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://marmadukeexplained.blogspot.com/">Marmaduke Explained</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ8BCNj2oao&amp;feature=related">George Washington</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://icanhascheezburger.com/">I can has cheeseburger</a></li>
</ul>
There are these and so much more at ROFLcon. I am excited. The only thing I am disappointed about is the creator of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goatse.cx">goatse</a> won't be there anymore. He seems to have disappeared from the list :(.
