It's a great little tool that I picked up at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B0009KRY6Y%26tag=topstartup-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B0009KRY6Y%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Amazon for just under $100 </a>.
<h3>What it's good for</h3>
It's great for getting your folders looking great. Psychologically, there is a big impact when the labels on your folders are not big scribbles. This helps your brain to process a bunch of folders at once and makes it easier to keep everything alphabetized. One of the major advantages with this over a large sheet of labels in your printer is that you can do labels one at a time, which makes it a lot easier to just label one folder.
<h3>Included Software</h3>
<a href="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/dymosoftware.png"><img src="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/dymosoftware_small.thumbnail.png" alt="Dymosoftware" align="left" /></a>All in all, it takes about 30 seconds to create a label from the time you need a new folder label to the time you have one! The software works on both windows and mac and you can print from your office applications aswell. The labelwriter is also a great tool for creating the labels for all the letters you need to mail! For that, you may want the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=B0009VU7QC%26tag=topstartup-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/B0009VU7QC%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Twin Turbo</a> to be able to print more than one type of label at a time.
<h3>Why It's worth it</h3>
<a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/05/08/dymo-labelwriter-400-get-yourself-organized/dsc01693jpg-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-52" title="GTD Folders in Action"><img src="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/dsc01693.thumbnail.jpg" alt="GTD Folders in Action" align="left" /></a>It's hard to quantify a purchase like a labelwriter for $100 (or less). It doesn't save you money immediately but it is another tool in your arsenal to make you more efficient and organized. Over the long run, you will spend fewer hours rummaging through your  files for the one scrap of paper you need!
