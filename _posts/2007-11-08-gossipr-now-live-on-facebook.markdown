<a href="http://apps.facebook.com/gossipr">Gossipr</a>, the application I have been working on for a couple of weeks is now live. It is essentially a Web 2.0 way to <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/gossipr">spread gossip and rumors about your friends</a>. People usually spread rumors and gossip on the phone or even in email. Now, there's a better way<!--more-->

<h3>Gossipr beats email</h3>

	<li><strong>Anonymity</strong> - email can always get back to you! Gossipr lets you hide your identity</li>
	<li><strong>Reach</strong> - a great piece of gossip can be seen by hundreds of thousands of facebook users</li>
	<li><strong>Privacy</strong> - choose only those people whom you know and trust with your secrets - there's <em>no forward button</em> that leaves your email address attached</li>
</ul>

I hope you enjoy using <a href="http://apps.facebook.com/gossipr">Gossipr</a> as much as we've enjoyed making it! Let us know how we can make it a better place to spread your gossip and rumors.
