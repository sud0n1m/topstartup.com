From their email:<!--more-->
<blockquote>Why are we discontinuing Paid Access? Well, we're a small company and we engage in lots of rapid experiments. Paid Access was one of those, and to be honest, its performance didn't live up to our expectations.</blockquote>
Paid Access was a service PBWiki was offering to help content generators monetize their wikis. I had an idea to write an e-book on PBWiki and offer people access to it as I was writing. I've put that e-book on hold for now.

I was hopeful, but I can see why it wouldn't work. Paid access kills the collaborative nature of a wiki. It also requires the user to accept that they should pay for wiki content. This is quite a big departure from what users are used to and probably played a big role in the failure of the beta test.
