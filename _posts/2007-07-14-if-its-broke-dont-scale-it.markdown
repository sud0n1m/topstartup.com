Im reading the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0786158964%26tag=topstartup-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0786158964%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">4-hour work week by Timothy Ferriss</a>. Seth Godin recently <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/07/small-before-bi.html">touched upon a point</a> Tim Ferriss talked about in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0786158964%26tag=topstartup-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0786158964%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">4HWW</a>. Tim used a quote by the infamous Bill Gates to explain it.<!--more-->
<blockquote>The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.
- Bill Gates</blockquote>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%3FASIN=0786158964%26tag=topstartup-20%26lcode=xm2%26cID=2025%26ccmID=165953%26location=/o/ASIN/0786158964%253FSubscriptionId=1N9AHEAQ2F6SVD97BE02">Tim</a> talks of how to outsource to a Virtual Assistant:
<blockquote>Never automate something that can be eliminated, and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined. Otherwise, you waste someone else's time instead of your own, which now wastes your hard-earned cash.</blockquote>
These are valuable points. In larger businesses and even small businesses in which I've worked, "because that's the way we've always done it" is too often the answer to a question.

<strong>When starting a new business, get your processes and procedures down before you scale.</strong>
