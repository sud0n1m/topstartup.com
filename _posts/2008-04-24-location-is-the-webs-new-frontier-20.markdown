It's a big world out there and location is an axis on which everyone is dying to slice you up.

You don't have to be <a href="http://www.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/15-06/ps_transparency">on the terrorist watch list</a> to get value putting your location online. I've picked my horse and it's <a href="http://fireeagle.yahoo.net/">Fire Eagle</a>.

There are a bunch of other horses for storing your location. <strong>They are irrelevant</strong>. Everyone else wants to trap "where" in a walled garden. Fire Eagle allows developers to create applications around providing your location. I'm using Navizon on my iPhone to update Fire Eagle. Fire Eagle also allows developers to create applications that utilize your location. Dan Choi helped me build the map to the right using Fire Eagle -&gt;.

Why should I tell Twitter where I am and Google Maps where I am. I want to tell Fire Eagle where I am and let Fire Eagle tell everyone else - at the level of granularity I choose.

Developers take notice: Support fire eagle for location based services or you are a second tier web 2.0 app.
