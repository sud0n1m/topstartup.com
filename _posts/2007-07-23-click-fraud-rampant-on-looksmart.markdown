Google is the gorilla in the room and offers great tools to track the conversions of other systems. Unfortunately, I cant give you specific numbers. I can tell you that Google, Yahoo and Microsoft are all within 1 - 2 percentage points of each other. Looksmart is around 10% lower than the others on conversions. <!--more-->Does this mean that click fraud is rampant? Or is the answer, that users like to click but not convert on looksmart. Either way, performance is significantly better on other sites. If you're doing PPC advertising, Looksmart will likely disappoint.
