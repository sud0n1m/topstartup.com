Unfortunately, their debaucheries <a href="http://washingtoncitypaper.com/display.php?id=2008">have been exposed in a scathing article</a> by Angela Valdez, a reporter for the Washington City Paper.

Some highlights:
<blockquote>Then the bearded one in the middle busts out with this: â€œDo you like anal sex?â€ I squint. Iâ€™m confused. â€œDo you do anal?â€ he repeats, head bobbing with excitement. The litany continues. Do I want to take it in the ass? Have I ever taken it in the ass? My silence is taken as an affirmative and he announces that this interview will go no further unless he receives a hand job.</blockquote>

And a revealing post on the forums:
<blockquote>RE: Figuring out if girls are sluts

all women are whores at heartâ€¦they will always slut themselves out at some point in their lives to get somethingâ€¦especially something shiny and expensive</blockquote>
Most of the people on the site are young conservatives (code word for republicans?)
<blockquote>Most categorize their political views as conservative. Many are Episcopalian or Presbyterian. The overwhelming majority are white. Some people describe themselves simply as WASP.</blockquote>
Are exclusive social networks like this good for communities? Is it wrong to expose them for what they are?
