I've got a small problem. Lack of funds. Right now, my benefactor is giving me enough money to get by, but I am still eating into my savings. So, I probably should get some kind of additional income. What I do know is that it won't be from this blog, or any other internet games I can do on the side. 
<ul>
	<li>I could get a job at a coffeeshop for a few hours a day - some good mindless work</li>
	<li>I could try and start doing IT consulting. I have the expertise</li>
	<li>I could try getting a job delivering mail (or something else mundane) at a financial services company - could be a good networking opportunity.</li>
</ul>



Really though, I am stumped for what is the best use of my time. Can anyone suggest anything?
