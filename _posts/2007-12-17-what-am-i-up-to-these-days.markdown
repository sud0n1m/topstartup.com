I've dropped hints here and there. It's an awesome new twist to my tale. It's great experience and great fun. Im now working at Virosity <!--more-->

<a href="http://virosity.com">Virosity</a> provides development and product management services for early stage start-ups. Our typical client has an idea, and access to funds but doesnt want to / have the connections to hire a full development team to get it done. That's where we come in! We turn great ideas into reality.

Right now, my team is building <a href="http://good2gether.com">good2gether</a>. From good2gether:
<blockquote>good2gether is a new search and social web service that connects people to causes.
And it's about to reinvent philanthropy.</blockquote>

So far, the good2gether experience has been really educational. Greg McHale is a great CEO. He spends more time on the road selling than anyone I know. <a href="http://good2gether.typepad.com/">Check out his blog</a> to see what part of the country he is in today!

good2gether is a fantastic product. Im thrilled to be building it. Look for more on Virosity and good2gether soon.

As a side note, we're looking for talented front end designers, and ruby on rails developers to add to the team. Our Boston launch date is fast approaching.
