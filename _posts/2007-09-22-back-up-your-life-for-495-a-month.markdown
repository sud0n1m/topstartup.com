There is of course the <a href="http://mozy.com/registration/free?ref=3f9a896b&amp;kbid=38295&amp;m=16">free version allowing up to 2 gb of backup</a>. I tried the 2gb version and then upgraded to the <a href="http://www.mozy.com/?ref=3f9a896b&amp;kbid=38295&amp;m=5">unlimited paid version for 4.95 a month</a>.

I currently am in the process of backing up 30gb of information. My big problem is that I am using Comcast at the office and at home which means slooooow upload speeds.<!--more-->

People often ignore the value of offsite backup. What happens if your harddrive dies. What happens if your house burns down. As we rely more and more on digital data, a service like Mozy becomes essential.

Mozy makes it easy to select what you want backed up. Once you're ready to back up, Mozy gets the job done with little work from you!

The reason I chose Mozy over others is because of their <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/23/tiny-startup-mozy-nails-multi-million-dollar-ge-storage-contract/">deal with GE</a> . If mozy is good enough for GE, it's good enough for me.
