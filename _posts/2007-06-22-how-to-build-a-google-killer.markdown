They are set to revolutionize the way you search. Think: Ask Jeeves that actually works. The product is not yet out, so testing it is right now is out of the question. If they are the next google, then they must be smart, right? So, what software tools are they using to build it? I found a list on a Powerset job posting for a project manager:
<!--more-->
<a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/" title="Jira"><strong>Jira</strong></a> - Commercial bug tracking software
<a href="http://twiki.org/"><strong>Twiki</strong></a> - Perl based open source wiki used by many big companies
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/"><strong>SVN</strong></a> - Subversion's version control system has all but killed CVS in new companies
<a href="http://www.taleo.com/"><strong>Taleo</strong></a> - HR slipped this in. Taleo is for managing hiring / firing / keeping tabs on employees<a href="http://www.merlin2.net/">
<strong>Merlin</strong></a> - Project management on Mac OS X. It's purtier than MS Project.

Powerset's COO Steve Newcomb also made an interesting announcement. The front-end for search will be Ruby. Powerset is hiring the brightest Ruby devs around. <a href="http://www.blognewcomb.com/blog/2007/06/powerset_launching_with_ruby.html">Check out his blog</a> for all the details.
