I was in the office of a recruiter today. It was a good meeting. I left my mont-blanc there though, but that's another story.<!--more--> When I came out - who is there, but <a href="http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/the_pick_up_artist/series_characters.jhtml">Pradeep</a> from "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pick-up_Artist_(TV_series)">The Pickup Artist</a>", a reality show that was on VH1 this year.

He was portrayed pretty poorly on the show; mainly because he was vindictive and would do things to ruin his show-mates conversations with women. I asked him about this. He said that, he did do those things and the portrayal was pretty accurate. That was quite surprising! I don't know how I run into these people!
