We've received good advice from many people on books we should be reading. Books are expensive, and this advice will save you money. It is rather obvious, but I wasn't taking my own advice (I love amazon!).

Quote from good will hunting (said with Boston accent)
<blockquote>you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on a f***in' education you coulda' got for a dollar fifty in late charges at the public library.</blockquote>

Unless your startup is rolling in the dough, get a library card. The library has a wealth of books - especially in larger and academic cities like Boston. Use these resources to get the knowledge you lack without forking over dough.
