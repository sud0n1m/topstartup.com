I wrote last month about <a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/09/22/back-up-your-life-for-495-a-month/">how great Mozy was</a>. Well, It's a month later and I was never able to backup my 30 gigs. It was slowly getting there. I had 3 gigs remaining. The problem is, Mozy's servers cant handle the capacity. During the week I was always getting errors that the server couldnt be reached.<!--more-->

In addition, the Mozy client for mac is a resource hog. When it prepares the files to send, it renders your computer unusable. Im pretty sure it's not necessary to slow your computer to a crawl to back up. 

Thus, I withdraw my endorsement of Mozy. Even with Time Machine on your mac, an off-site backup of your data is highly recommended. I'll try out a few options and make a recommendation.
