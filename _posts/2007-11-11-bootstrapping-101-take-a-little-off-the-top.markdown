However, you can use the principle to apply to any facet of your life. Bootstrapping helps you identify and eliminate waste. It forces you to make hard decisions on what's really important and what isn't.  Whether you're starting a business, trying to get your finances in order or save for retirement. There are times when anyone will want to bootstrap.<!--more-->

<h3>Where to cut back</h3>
<a href="http://img124.imageshack.us/img124/1067/bootstraphaircutlr0.jpg"><img src="http://img223.imageshack.us/img223/9350/bootstrappinghaircutey4.jpg" alt="Bootrappers haircut" align="left"/></a>I can't stop my hair growing. As hard as I will it to stop, my hair keeps on trucking. To prevent myself looking like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cousin_Itt">Cousin Itt's</a> twin brother, I need to take care of it. That generally means going to get a haircut. I've gone to chinatown in boston to save a few bucks, but the guy didnt speak english and I ended up with a great fade, but a terrible haircut. I've also gone to newbury st. but ended up with a mediocre haircut for a big price. It's really not that hard to cut a guys hair. So, my buddy Ben "Le Coiffure" Winterroth does it for me. It's a great way to save some loot. There are times however, that going the cheap route is not better.

<h3>Where to spend top dollar</h3>

Say it with me <em>Ramen is not nutrition</em>. Food is one area where I will never try to be cheap. The picture to the left is my dinner from Friday. Chicken breast with broccoli and spinach-carrot salad. My <a href="http://www.idlewords.com/2006/04/argentina_on_two_steaks_a_day.htm">diet might change when I'm in Argentina</a>, but in general I buy organic, and cook dinner at home. If you try it for a week, I guarantee you'll notice the difference in your alertness, happiness and overall well-being.

These are just a couple of suggestions for how to and how not to bootstrap. What are the things you would never give up to save some cash?
