Let's face it, you don't run a Boeing 747 on regular unleaded*. The damn thing wouldn't fly! You don't run an entrepreneur on McDonald's either. You just can't get the energy from a greasy burger, fries and soda to build a new company.
<h3>Eating Right</h3>
<strong>You can save money on office supplies, clothing, drinking, women, but don't skimp on fresh food!</strong>

When at the supermarket, your best bet is to buy lots of fruits and vegetables and make your own meals. If you can't cook (you should learn), try and stay away from the frozen food that is heavy in potatoes, pasta and other starchy carbs. <a href="http://www.eatyourbest.com/">Smart Ones</a> has many options that skip the starch for green veggies. Also, try different things out to see how they make you feel. Personally, I feel better when I substitute rice for wheat. Accordingly, I prefer to eat rice cakes instead of bread. I substitute oatmeal instead of a wheat based cereal. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa">Quinoa</a> is another great alternative grain to have with meals. It's higher in protein than wheat and has a balanced set of amino acids! Now that your belly is full, we're moving on to jump-starting your mind.
<h3>Brain enhancing drugs</h3>
We all need to perk up and switch our brains on now and then. For an alternative to coffee, try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yerba_mate">Yerba Mate</a>. Mate is a great alternative to coffee that doesn't make your breath or pee strange. I usually drink it with honey and milk. My colleague Ryan seems to drink a lot of sugar free red bull, but that makes me feel a little too wired. If you do opt for coffee, I saw on the today show that <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/6242467/">unfiltered coffee (aka the expensive stuff) causes high cholesterol</a>.
<h3>Eating out</h3>
This is the hard one to do well. Generally, it is hard to eat balanced on the cheap when eating out. Generally, I try and avoid eating out because of it. My budget for a meal out is generally $10 a head or less (which is also what I would be willing to spend on a good meal at home). Occasionally, we go out for a nice dinner. You can take a look at the places I like to go on my <a href="http://colinn.yelp.com">Yelp! profile</a>.

*Speaking of flying, I just got in to London this morning and was met by my dad and good friend Shawn at the airport. We grabbed some breakfast at the airport and it was then proven to me that it is STILL possible to get bad food in England. It was one of these british chains - the name slips my memory. I got the traditional english breakfast - fried egg, bacon, sausage, tomato, mushrooms (It was terrible). So, the point is - do as I say, not as I do!
