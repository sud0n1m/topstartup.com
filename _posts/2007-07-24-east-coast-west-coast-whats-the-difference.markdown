Scott Kirsner has written a cheeky article in the Boston Globe "<a href="http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2007/07/22/will_boston_ever_catch_up/">Will Boston ever catch up?</a>". In it he criticizes Massachusetts for focusing too much on corporate technology and not enough on consumer technology. How does a Boston startup get Boston VC funds? Move to California!<!--more-->
<blockquote>Many Boston area investors, like [Todd] Dagres, aren't hesitant about pouring their millions into California start-ups and hopping on planes</blockquote>
I don't think it is as dire as Kirsner puts it, but I do think that when you get your first round of funding, moving your headquarters can be an important step towards getting seen. My friend Lee is even <a href="http://biketripblog.com">biking to silicon valley</a> and moving <a href="http://elifelist.com/">eLifeList.com</a> from New York to be closer to money.
