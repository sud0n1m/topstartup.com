Too long ago, I asked the question "<a href="http://topstartup.com/2007/04/24/what-side-job-should-an-entrepreneur-have/">What side job should an entrepreneur have?</a>". I also asked <a href="http://onstartups.com/About/AboutDharmeshShah/tabid/4147/Default.aspx">Dharmesh Shah</a>, a software entrepreneur and angel investor the same. His recommendation:<!--more-->
<blockquote>Having read your blog article on the topic, I'd suggest against a mediocre job delivering mail or working at a coffee shop.

You might want to consider some type of internship with a startup or other hi-tech company. This won't pay that much, but should be more interesting.</blockquote>
Thanks for the advice!

Im now working with a seasoned veteran, Greg Gibson as an entrepreneur apprentice. Greg's latest venture is <a href="http://prayabout.com">PrayAbout.com</a>.
<h3>What is PrayAbout.com</h3>
<img src="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/prayabout.png" alt="PrayAbout" />

PrayAbout.com is a community driven, non-denominational site for prayer requests. People of all religions come to submit their prayer requests about that which affects them deeply. <img src="http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/prayabout_candles.thumbnail.png" title="PrayAbout Candles" alt="PrayAbout Candles" align="left" />What makes the site sticky is candles, a reward for action on the site. You start with none, but invite a friend and you each get 20 when they sign up. When people light candles for your prayer request, you get some of those. When you light candles for someone elses prayer request, you get some of the candles lit after you.

Some of the things Im interested in learning with this position are:
<ul>
	<li>How google adwords works and how to get great results from online advertising</li>
	<li>How to grow from startup to successful mainstay on the net</li>
	<li>How to do business with angel investors and venture capitalists</li>
	<li>How to stay on task with the things Im working on while holding a part time job</li>
</ul>
Wish me luck!
