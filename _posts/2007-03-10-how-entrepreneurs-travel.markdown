It's <a href="http://www.fungwahbus.com">Fung Wah Bus</a>. Im going on monday to meet <a href="/2007/02/14/luck-strikes-again-outsourcing-saves-money/">NetProSys</a> to discuss how we are going to use our $4000 in software development services. Well, I looked at my different options to get to Bridgewater, New Jersey.

<h3>Car</h3>
I dont have one anymore so this would mean renting. It would also mean driving a long distance. Something that is not a good use of my time!
<h3>Train</h3>
The train from boston to NY on Amtrak is $136 round trip. It leaves from Back Bay station which is walking distance. Then I would take the commuter rail to NJ at a cost of $20 round trip for a grand total of $156. The only problem with this is that the train back to Back Bay from Penn Station returns at 2:00 pm. So likely, I would have to go to a different station in Boston if I wanted to leave later.

<h3>Multi-modal</h3>
To save the most money, Im going multi modal. Im taking the T (subway) to South Station (i've already paid for a monthly pass), then taking the Fung Wah Bus - $30 round trip, then taking the subway to Penn Station - $4 round trip and then taking the commuter rail to NJ $20 round trip for a total cost of $54. This is less than half the Amtrak cost.

Time wise, I anticipate the Multi-Modal route to take me an additional 2 hrs, so I will be valuing my time as at least $51 an hour. During this time, I will be able to read, and work on my laptop, so the real cost to me of the longer route is even less!

As an entrepreneur, a little bit of ingenuity can save you a bunch of money. If you apply this across all facets of your business, you're less likely burn through cash on things like travel and will be able to spend more money building your core business.

<h3>Update: How it worked out</h3>
Multi-modal was good. I got lost getting from the Fung Wah Bus to the subway and getting from the subway to the fung wah bus. This meant that I missed the 7pm bus and took the 8pm bus instead. If you have the extra money or someone else is paying, Amtrak is a better way to go. If you are spending your money. Go by Fung Wah!
