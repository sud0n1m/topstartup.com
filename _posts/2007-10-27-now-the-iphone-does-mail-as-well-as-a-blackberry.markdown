If I read something on my iPhone, it was still unread in my gmail, and my inbox.

Basically, the way it <em>should work</em> is: if I read it on my phone, my laptop, my desktop or the web, it should be marked as read everywhere. You couldn't do this out of the box.<!--more-->

I took a crazy approach to making this happen. One weekend, I set up my own IMAP server on my Slicehost server and downloaded my mail to my slice. I then connected all devices to that IMAP server.

Well, someone else though that was a good idea. Google. Finally, google has started providing IMAP for Gmail. Check out these instructions on how to <a href="http://5thirtyone.com/archives/862">set up IMAP for Gmail on your iPhone</a>

If you still don't get why IMAP is cool, check out <a href="http://www.bath.ac.uk/bucs/email/images/imap-client.server.png">this diagram comparing POP and IMAP</a>.
