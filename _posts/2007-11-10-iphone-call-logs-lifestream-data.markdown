What? Where? When? Why? - Who is doing it?, What are they doing?, Where are they doing it? When are they doing it? <a href="http://twitter.com/topstartup">Twitter</a> attacks the "what" problem well. Their goal is to capture anytime, anywhere what you want to disclose you are doing and make it public. Well, this is all good and well, but I'd like to know a little more.<!--more-->

My interests are more along the lines of capturing and utilizing my own lifestream data to add context and relevance to the things I do on a daily basis. Im interesting in understanding - where I was when I made a phone call, or had an IM conversation. Who is at a conference or event with me. This might sound obsessive to some. Im a firm believer that the memory works better in context. The context of a meeting or event can trigger other memories and pieces of information.

<h3>Super cool command line software</h3>
I found a new tool that helps me get closer to that goal:<a href="http://code.google.com/p/iphonelogd/">iphonelogd</a>

It's very cool and really simple. You just need to get over the fear of the command line! <code>ruby iphonelogd.rb Calls</code>. Just give it the name of the calendar you want to put the data into and you're done! One step.

<h3>What can you do with it?</h3>
One cool use for this is to find out when the last time you spoke to a friend, relative or business associate was. You can use that information to add context - maybe that was the day you went to the dentist, or your wife had a baby since then. Having that information handy better equips you to make conversation.
