<a href='/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/whereiwork.jpg' title='My Office'><img src='http://topstartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/whereiwork.thumbnail.jpg' alt='My Office' align="left" /></a>Here is where I work right now. I've got my headset for skype conversations, an extra monitor to get rid of my desktop clutter, an external harddrive for backing up, printer,  a wooden chair (I would kill for an aeron), a borrowed desk, clock, iPod HiFi for music. It's a pretty basic setup... oh, and off to the right is our first development "server", if you could call it that... an old Powerbook G4 that I got in 2003. All in all, it's pretty basic and low-cost.
