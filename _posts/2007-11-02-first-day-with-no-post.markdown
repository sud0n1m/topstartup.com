Ok, so there is some irony in that statement. It has however been a while since I missed posting on a weekday. My reasons: I started a new job. Dan and I have also been working hard on gossipr, a new (and amazing!) facebook application that I love, and I hope you'll love too. More on both of those topics soon.
