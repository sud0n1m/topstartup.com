<h1>Spain</h1>  
<p> Im doing my entry for Spain from Bangkok since I didnt really get a chance in my 6 hours back in London. So far, I havent been to somewhere I didnt like. I had a great time in Marbella with Duncan. We spent a lot of time in Puerto Banus at the bars down there. Duncan is working for a promotions company called<a href="http://www.sintillate.co.uk/sun.htm"> Sintillate</a> doing a lot of &quot;PR&quot;ing (I guess that stands for public relations) with the basic goal of trying to create awareness of the various events <a href="http://www.sintillate.co.uk/sun.htm">Sintillate</a> is putting on. I flew over there on <a href="http://www.easyjet.com">Easyjet</a> which was pretty reasonable and compares with Southwest, however I think the planes are newer. The plane I had back was only seven weeks old. You can really tell based on cabin noise that Airbus has an edge over Boeing. The plane was pretty quiet, and I was right next to the engine! So as for my trip to Spain, we hung out a lot at <a href="http://www.linekers-bar.com/html/bar_7.shtml">Lineker's </a>which belongs to the brother of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=gary%20lineker&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi">Gary Lineker</a> (the famous british soccer player). One night we went to <em>Pangia</em> where <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001710/">David Schwimmer</a> and his gang were (i only saw them the next day at a beach party) and another night we went to <em><a href="http://www.dreamers-disco.com/menu.html">Dreamers</a></em>. The night we were at <em><a href="http://www.dreamers-disco.com/menu.html">Dreamers</a></em>, Teddy Sheringham (another british soccer player) got turned away because he had trainers/sneakers on. I guess in Spain, they dont know any of the British celebs. Unfortunately, while I was there I didnt take many<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim/PhotoAlbum12.html"> pictures</a> when we were out so all I really have to show is <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim/PhotoAlbum12.html">a few shots</a> of Duncan's place.<br></p>

<pre><code>    &lt;br&gt;
    I got burnt the first day I was there and right now I feel like a snake shedding its skin. I met some nice people there, however, I think Puerto Banus is a really pretentious place. There were a lot of &amp;quot;beautiful people&amp;quot; walking around and all of the designer stuff got a little on my nerves. I had a great time hanging out with Duncan and I know that all the free drinks I was fed didnt hurt my enjoyment there. Thailand is great so far. It is my second day and I am loving it. Asia is awesome. I ate dinner last night for $1.50. Even the expensive restaurants are cheaper relative to europe and the states. Thailand is well worth the 10 hour trip from London. I would do it again in a heartbeat.
