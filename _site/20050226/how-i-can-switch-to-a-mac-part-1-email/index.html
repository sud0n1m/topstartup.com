<h1>How I can switch to a Mac for work: Part 1 - Email</h1>  
<p>After my last article: <a href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/20050205/why-i-cant-switch-to-a-mac/">Why I cant switch to a Mac</a>, there were a lot of great responses. As a disclaimer, I wrote it in frustration, but I was not looking to bitch, I was looking for some answers. The biggest frustration I had was with email. After reading through your responses, I had a couple of new solutions to try to solve my email dilemma: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a> and <a href="http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/features/evolution.html">Novell Evolution</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Novell Evolution</strong>
<a href="http://www.novell.com/products/desktop/features/evolution.html">Novell Evolution</a>, originally Ximian Evolution is the fullest featured email / calendaring app in the linux / unix world. It is currently at version 2 and is a testament to the strength of the open source model. Recently, Novell released to the open source community, the <a href="http://www.novell.com/news/press/archive/2004/05/pr04034.html">Ximian Connector</a> - the plugin for Evolution that allows the most complete operability with Exchange servers outside of Microsoft Outlook. <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~aaron/doing/evo-osx.html">Evolution can work on Mac OS X</a>  also, but it is not a native app and must be compiled and use elements in the Gnome Tool Kit. The Mac port also lags behind in its version. <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">Fink</a> lists it at <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/pdb/package.php/evolution">1.4.6</a> as of this writing and the Ximian Connector has not been ported to Mac yet.
Hopefully Apple is working to include the Ximian Connector or elements of it in future versions of <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Mail</a> / iCal and <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/addressbook/">Address Book</a>.  It would be a shame not to!</p>

<p><strong>Mozilla Thunderbird</strong>
Now, with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Mozilla Thunderbird</a>, do I have a solution? Lets take a look. I downloaded the latest release of <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">thunderbird</a> and fired it up. I put in all my information and it started catching up on about 300 mb of messages. <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a> was noticably faster at downloading messages than both <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/mail/">Apple Mail</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/entourage2004/entourage2004.aspx?pid=entourage2004">Microsoft Entourage 2003</a>. One of the complaints I had with all previous mail clients I had tried on the Mac is the lack of fully functional HTML. A lot of users had a great deal of criticism about my need for HTML. I agree. HTML is a waste for simple text messages which is the majority of normal communication over email. However, I would much rather have a full-featured HTML option rather than just the basics. Tables help with formatting, especially when you are sending multiple lines of similar data. Now I am happy with the email sending, receiving and formatting. What about addresses. One of the weaknesses with Thunderbird is the inability to connect to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/addressbook/">built in Address book</a>. Not a big deal. Thunderbird was not designed to integrate in with the native address book on each system. I have not yet figured out a good way to synchronize my contacts to the Mac. Once I do that, Thunderbird will be a pretty great email solution for any platform.</p>

<p><em>What works:</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>Fastest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAP">IMAP</a> support I have seen on the Mac (nice job Mozilla!)</li>
    <li>Nice interface and easy to use</li>

</ul>


<p><em>What Doesnt:</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>No built in address import from Exchange server - limited ability to import other address book typess</li>
    <li>Not integrated well into the OS (but it works on all platforms!)</li>
    <li>Cannot synchronize with a <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Thunderbird_:_FAQs_:_PalmSync">palm/blackberry on the mac (yet)</a></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Where to go from here</strong>
Mozilla Thunderbird fills my needs pretty well. My colleagues and I share an address book that is in an outlook public folder. If I were able to synchronize this or use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP">LDAP</a> to access it (dont think you can with public folders, only the global address list), then I would be well on my way to replacing my Windows PC. I am looking forward to companies integrating the Ximian Connector into their software, or others porting Evolution to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/">Cocoa</a>. I think the future is bright. Look out for the next installment of my trials switching to the Mac.</p>
