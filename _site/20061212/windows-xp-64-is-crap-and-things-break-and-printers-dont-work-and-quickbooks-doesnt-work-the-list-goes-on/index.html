<h1>Windows XP 64 is crap and things break and printers dont work and quickbooks doesnt work the list goes on</h1>  
<!--adsense#TopAds-->


<p>So, I thought I would do a review of my experience with Windows XP 64. I guess the place to start is:</p>

<p><strong>Why I bought Windows XP 64.</strong>
I was shopping online for a new computer for one of our employees and saw that Dell was selling these workstations with Intel Core 2 Duo processors (64 bit chips!) with cheap upgrades ($10 + shipping) to Windows Vista. Well, if you bought Windows XP, you only got an upgrade to 32 bit Windows Vista. At this point, I had a lot of faith in Microsoft Windows Vista, and thought that for sure, within 1 year, no one would be buying and installing the 32 bit Vista... that technology is for the dinosaurs. So, the option I had (for no additional cost) was to buy the 64 bit Windows XP and get the upgrade to 64 bit Windows Vista Business. I didn't think / have time to research potential problems with that decision and thought that I was making a smart choice.</p>

<p>The computer arrived and I booted in to Windows XP 64 and noticed one thing that immediately concerned me... two versions of Internet Explorer. <em>Gulp</em>. If they've got two versions of Internet Explorer, then that means that some things don't work correctly on the 64 bit version and you need to use the 32 bit version. This was a sign of problems to come.</p>

<p><strong>Installation and Set up</strong>
Well, the next step was to set up office which was pre-installed. Im pretty sure there isn't a 64 bit compiled Office 2003 so there was probably no benefit with running that on a 64 bit system. So, after a few hiccups and some concerns I got the machine up to spec and was ready to send it to our other office. The morning I am going to send it, I had to finish one install before it left. As I am using the computer, I get a BSOD. Uh oh. The computer shouldn't BSOD when it is brand new. Those unfamiliar with BSODs or Blue Screen of Death might want to note that these are usually caused by poorly coded device drivers.</p>

<p>Well, I dismissed that first BSOD to dumb luck, packed the computer up and sent it on its merry way. The next thing to do when it is on site, is to install all the printer drivers... no problem! Well, it wouldn't be a problem on regular windows... but 64 bit, better Windows doesn't have the same support for printers that its weaker smaller brother does. HP attempted to address this by having a unified driver for all of its printers for XP 64. What HP probably didnt do was test it on all their printers. I wasn't able to get it to work on the HP Color Laserjet 2500.</p>

<p>So, I said I would try and fix it later and would look for a solution online. Well, the next step was installing Quickbooks. I was a little nervous by this time, so did a search and found the following disappointing information about <a href="http://www.quickbooksgroup.com/webx/forums/Online%20Services/Emailing%20Invoices%2C%20Statements%2C%20P.O.s%2C%20etc./193/15?50">compatibility of Quickbooks in Windows XP 64</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Use</strong>
Well, as it happens, the computer has started crashing and showing BSODs multiple times per day. Looks like we are going to have to send it back to Dell and get the 32 bit Windows XP.</p>

<p>Morale of the story is - if you are using Microsoft products, stay away from the cutting edge - it sucks pretty bad.</p>
