<h1>The Good Shepherd - a review - spoiler warning</h1>  
<p>Through Katie, I received a freebie ticket to "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0343737/">The Good Shepherd</a>", a new movie about the CIA through the eyes of one character, Edward Wilson played by Matt Damon. The movie spans the 20s, when Wilson sees his father commit suicide, to his days at Yale where he joins the illustrious Skull &amp; Bones secret society, to his entrance into the OSS during world war II, to the formation of the CIA, to the bay of pigs fiasco..... wow I am out of breath. That is a lot to cover in a movie, which is why the movie is about 2 hrs and 30 minutes long. I must warn the reader, that if your favorite movie is "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377092/">Mean Girls</a>", this is not for you. I am a history buff and am fascinated with life in the United States pre 1970, so this movie was right up my alley. Had it not been, I would be pretty bored, which I suppose the two teeny-bopper girls next to me were when they left after about 35 - 40 minutes.</p>

<h2>Strengths</h2>


<p>The strengths of the movie lie in the directors ability to bring this history to life and use Damon's character as a vehicle for viewing history. Wilson is a stoic man, who does not say much. In fact, based on the interactions with other characters, you sense that Wilson is well respected by peers, enemies and the like, but either the director wants to purvey that he does not see this in himself, or Damon's performance is unconvincing. You be the judge.</p>

<h2>Weaknesses</h2>


<p>Weaknesses are certainly the length. There are several, interesting but irrelevant forays into topics that have no bearing on the plot. For example, Wilson is asked to be a "bonesman" while performing dressed in drag in a play at Yale. This is amusing, but irrelevant. We could have had this part left out and just jumped straight into him being in the "Skull &amp; Bones".</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>


<p>Overall, I would rate this as a 7/10. Anything over 5, I think you should go watch. I believe in a true average being 5/10 and this movie is certainly above the average crap that Hollywood seems to love to churn out.</p>

<p>As an afterthought, I would recommend this movie to people who enjoyed the movies "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362269/">Kinsey</a>", and/or "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0268978/">A Beautiful Mind</a>". These movies all feature the same sorrowful brilliance of the protagonist.</p>
