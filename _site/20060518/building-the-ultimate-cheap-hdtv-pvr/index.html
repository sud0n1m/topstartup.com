<h1>Building the Ultimate (cheap) HDTV PVR</h1>  
<p>I've been working on my Ultimate (cheap) HDTV PVR for a few weeks now. See the previous articles (<a href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/index.php/20060423/building-the-ultimate-cheap-hdtv-pvr-part-1/">1</a>, <a href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/index.php/20060426/building-the-ultimate-cheap-hdtv-pvr-part-11/">2</a>, <a href="http://www.pintmaster.com/wordpress/index.php/20060430/building-the-ultimate-cheap-hdtv-pvr-part-12/">3</a>) that detail my problems. I've purchased a ton of hardware and returned a ton of hardware. Here's what I am left with and approximate prices:</p>

</ul>


<p><strong>Mistakes Made
</strong></p>

<p>I've made a bunch of mistakes building my HTPC. When the computer kept rebooting / stalling, I wrongly attributed it to hardware / driver problems. My assumption was compounded when I read that people were having problems with the turtle beach montego (my original HTPC sound card). I ended up spending a lot more when I had to keep returning hardware. I now think that the problem was with the original PSU in the Antec Sonata failing. It was rated at 380w and when I ran through the <a href="http://www.jscustompcs.com/power_supply/">Power calculator</a>, it seemed that it would be enough for my hardware, but apparently that is not the case. Either the PSU is failing or the hardware is much more power hungry than the calculator thought.</p>

<p><strong>What can you do with it?
</strong></p>

<p>Now that I've just dropped a grand on this box, what can I do with it?</p>

<p><em>Recording TV</em> - You'll now be able to set media center to record your favorite shows for you in High Definition. Some pitfalls here are: you need a really strong signal. I purchased a Terk indoor antenna, but the signal is weak. I am within 15 miles of all the broadcast towers in Houston, but my directional antenna only picks up 2 stations well from inside my house. The rest of them are pretty choppy. Im going to try buying a $100 antenna and put it in my attic run a cable down to my living room.</p>

<p><em>Downloading Torrents </em>- While my TV channels dont fully work, I've got to use uTorrent to subscribe to shows on <a href="http://tvrss.net">tvRSS.net</a> in order to get my fill. I've also got my Scientific Atlanta Explorer 8300HD on Time Warner cable as a backup :)</p>

<p><em>Music - </em>Im not using it for music. This is when it sucks to have all your music in iTunes. It would be nice if someone (Apple ?) wrote an iTunes interface for Windows Media Center (but I cant see why they would)
<em>Gaming</em> -  I dont use it for big screen gaming, but I can see myself getting a wireless controller and maybe installing MAME or an NES / SNES emulator.</p>

<p><strong>Is it ready for primetime?</strong></p>

<p>If you are an inexperienced user thinking about building a HTPC, no, it's not. Even if you are an experienced user, it may be more pain than its worth. Especially the quirks with OTA broadcasts. In fact - right now I would prefer to download a torrent of the show rather than record it over the air.</p>

<p>This quirkiness / lack of seamless integration is where apple really has an "in" into the living room. Steve jobs recently stated "we hear you  load and clear" when asked about a potential Apple media center. The Mac Mini is a great little platform. It will be fantastic if they can integrate a dual HD and SD tuner into that package, or even have a little add on. Im a little disappointed with the inflexibility of the Windows Media Center software. It's missing a lot - such as the ability to automatically compress a recorded show to Divx. This is a relatively young product, but unfortunately, it still acts like a computer and not enough like an appliance. This is where the failing is. Things dont "just work".</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
Im not happy with Windows MCE 2005. Frankly, recording on my $12/month Scientific Atlanta 5300hd box is better than my $1000 Windows MCE 2005 box. I'd like to try and make this work by installing <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/">MythTV</a> on Ubuntu which seems to offer more flexibility, but I am waiting for Dapper Drake to come out around the beginning of June to do it right. Im very conflicted about this right now. I want to watch TV how and when I want to watch it. I want to do it legally and in High Definition when possible. I dont want to have to pay 60 bucks a month to Time Warner Cable to watch my 5 or so shows that I can get free over the air. The kicker right now is that with my current setup, it is more inconvenient to try and record in HD over the air than it is to download the torrent. I will make this work! Keep your eyes on this space.</p>
