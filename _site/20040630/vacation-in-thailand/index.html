<h1>Vacation in Thailand</h1>  
<pre><code>Hello again, and welcome to my interesting vacation. This week is filled with more exciting news. This time, it is about Thailand, coming to you live from Australia! I am on my third day in Oz, and I am having a great time. The Holland vs. Portugal match is on tonight and we have to get up at 4:00 am if we want to watch it. We will.
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://homepage.mac.com/sudonim/PhotoAlbum13.html"&gt;The pictures are here by the way.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;So, about Thailand. I spent all of my time in Bangkok staying with my friend Bob from &lt;a href="http://www.rpi.edu"&gt;RPI&lt;/a&gt;. He has a &lt;a href="http://img.periskop.cz/media/img/land_rover_discovery01.jpg"&gt;car&lt;/a&gt; there and drove me around everywhere. I saw the major touristy sights, a few of the Wots (temples) and the Royal Palace. I had a big night out one night and I did some shopping at the night markets there. I have to say though, I like a lot about Thailand, I have a few things that were sour milk to me. I made a list below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;table width="100%"  border="1" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1"&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th width="50%" scope="col"&gt;Likes&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th width="50%" scope="col"&gt;Dislikes&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Food - I had some great seafood as well as noodle soup dishes. Eating out is really inexpensive however the 'hawker stall' style places are not as high quality as Singapore. &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;People - Bob's family as well as his two close friends, Kiang and Keng were tremendously hospitable. I hardly was able to pay for anything there because Bob would always talk to them in Thai and I wasnt able to do anything to pay!&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Prices - Everything is sooooooooo inexpensive! Anything that needs local labor, i.e. Golf caddying, Massage... etc.. is all really inexpensive. The more expensive places are on par with similar places in the states but the price is low. Great value for money. &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;People - I found something very uncomfortable about the way sex is thought of in Thai society. A documentary on the plane talks about anything more than holding hands being offensive, yet there are a lot of hookers on the sides of the roads and lots of people trying to get you in to see the sex shows all the time. I found it to be  a little trashy in some ways.
          &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://everything2.org/index.pl?node_id=16213"&gt;Transvestites&lt;/a&gt;! - There are way too many cross-dressers and really feminine guys! Im not sure why, culturally there are a lot of 'lady-boys' or whatever the term is but it seemed excessive&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Heat - I know I am going to regret thinking this, but it was really hot and humid in Thailand! Playing golf required a lot of drinking water and a lot of sweating&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/table&gt;      
  &lt;p&gt;I really enjoyed my time in Thailand, and I would love to go back. I hear that in the beach resort areas down south, the food is a little different (better) and people are different too. Every big city really will end up being the same. I saw McDonalds in a lot of places, and I got a great shirt there that has the logo and says 'McShit'. Doing it again, I would definitely get out of Bangkok. There is a lot to see there if u are interested in Temples and Night markets, and I had a nice time when we did that stuff, but I would definitely like to get out of Bangkok into the countryside more. Im sure you are all excited for my updates on Australia. It has been great so far. I will write towards the end. &lt;/p&gt;
