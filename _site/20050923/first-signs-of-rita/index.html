<h1>First signs of Rita</h1>  
<p>The wind has started to pick up now. It is raining on and off. It just feels ominous outside.</p>

<p>I decided to tape up the east and north facing windows with Duck Tape. I dont know that it will really do anything, but at least it makes me feel like I have done everything I could. It seems that the Hurricane is continuing on its path to make landfall at Port Arthur / Beaumont - about 120 miles or so from Houston. This looks a lot better for us, but not so good for those in Port Arthur / Beaumont. I didnt hear anything on the TV yet about them being evacuated, so I am not sure if most are still there. I visited a chevron blend plant in Beaumont about a month ago and there is not that much there... just a bunch of refineries, but the devastation to that area Im sure will be tremendous, just not as bad as a direct hit on Houston.</p>

<p>We had dinner a little while ago. I made chicken with spinach and asparagus. Im not sure when we will have our electric stove again, and am wishing that I had a gas stove other than my barbeque grill downstairs.</p>

<p>Everyone here is worried about the looting. I know nick had tried to get a shotgun. I would like to have one too. A couple of signs we have seen so far are "You Loot, We Shoot" and "Protected by Smith and Wesson" in front of peoples houses. I think it might be a good idea to put a sign outside as a deterrent to people to come in to our house.</p>

<p>All this waiting is really frustrating. Come on already Rita. We're ready for you to come, if only because that means we are closer to you leaving.</p>
