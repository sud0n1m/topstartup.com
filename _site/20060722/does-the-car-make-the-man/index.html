<h1>Does the car make the man?</h1>  
<p>I bought a 2004 Honda Accord EX 3.0 V6 a couple of months ago before I was single. The payment on it is about 450 bucks. Now I am single, I got this stupid idea (from people at work) that I needed to buy a BMW 3 series. Now, the young and irresponsible me wants to buy a BMW 3 series. However, the responsible me believes that the Honda Accord was the right decision and it would be stupid to get rid of it.</p>

<p>A friend of mine suggested that buying the BMW may be an attempt (wrongly) to compensate for something I feel is missing from my life. I think this is the case. For some reason, I thought having a 3 series would make me more fun, exciting, attractive? to women. Well, that's really retarded. I think that it is natural to feel that way because that is what society pushes on us.</p>

<p>Now I realize that although appealing to have a nice car now, I would much rather be rich later. There is a saying in texas: "Big Hat, No Cattle". I've decided that many of the irresponsible youth you see at the hotspots in Houston are essentially "Big Hat, No Cattle". As much as my young reckless urges tempt me to be irresponsible, I am glad I have not.</p>

<p>The car does not make the man. I am embarassed to have thought it had any impact. Cars are fun and a waste of money, but they are essentially tools, and at 24, I dont need to be wasting money changing my tool to get me from a to b :)</p>
