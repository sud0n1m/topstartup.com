<h1>Why Apple Needs a Dock / Port Replicator for the MacBook Pro</h1>  
<p>We live in the era of the Desktop replacement notebook PC. It replaces the desktop computer, but not the desk. Like many people, when sitting at my desk, I prefer using an external monitor, keyboard and mouse plugged in to my MacBook Pro. I travel with my MacBook pro between work and home and find it frustrating to have to plug in 6 things when I get to work every day - Monitor, Ethernet, USB hub, Headphones, Power cord, external harddrive. My Thinkpad toting colleagues just drop their notebooks into the dock when they get in and hey-presto everything is up and running again.</p>

<p>I want to recommend the Macbook as the laptop that we should replace the thinkpads with when they come up for renewal. The macbook is certainly a compelling buy. For about 1600 bucks, you get a great business computer that can run windows. Users can even keep their personal lives separate and dual boot the computer.</p>

<p>As I said, I want to recommend the Macbook, but it needs to be easy for the business user. Thats where the dock comes in. Just drop it in, and everything is connected. In order for apple to move beyond the die-hard mac fan + home user market into the big bucks, they need to make the notebook more appealing to the business user.</p>

<p>Im <a href="http://www.icreatemagazine.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=193">not the only one that shares this sentiment</a></p>

<blockquote><span class="postbody">On my ThinkPad I have a small port replicator that I just click the laptop onto and all my connections are made. With the MacBook I have an array of fiddly connectors to plug-in spread over 2 sides of the book. I have to connect Power, Audio and USB to the left hand side. Then Plug in DVI-D video, Ethernet and Firewire on the right hand side.</span>

Well if that's not fiddily enough I have to open the lid of the book to press the power button as there is no way to turn on the book without opening it. The ThinkPad has a power button on the replicator. I have no need to use the built-in screen as my desktop display is plenty big enough and the internal screen is so poor. So I close the lid and of course the computer goes to sleep. So I then have to wake it up to use it, only problem is I can't wake it with a 3rd party Bluetooth keyboard and mouse so have to connect a USB mouse just so I can wake it up.

If Apple are going to make headway into corporate use they need to acknowledge that a laptop is taken to and from work every day and it is not practical to plug and unplug six or seven cables twice a day</blockquote>


<p>Apple. Please dont let down your business users. Our companies pay for laptops. We need you to make it a more compelling sell. Right now, I love my MacBook - but it is too hot for a laptop and too cumbersome for a desktop.</p>
