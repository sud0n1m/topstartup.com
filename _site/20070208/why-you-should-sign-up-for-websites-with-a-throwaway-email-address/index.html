<h1>Why you should sign up for websites with a throwaway email address</h1>  
<p>Whenever I sign up for a website, I sign up with the name of the website at pintmaster dot com. This is so I can track who sells my information on by the addresses I get spam to. Well, let this be a lesson to ye. Recently broke "Performancing" seems to have sold their email list. I just got some spam sent to that name at pintmaster dot com. Had I given them my personal address, I would likely have to change emails to prevent the spam coming in. Now I can just make performancing at pintmaster dot com a black hole email. Here's the spam email for reference:</p>
